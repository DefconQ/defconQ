However, we don't live in an ideal world. If your system goes down and you need to recover data ingested since the start of the day, the Tickerplant Log file is crucial for Disaster Recovery. The Tickerplant logs every incoming message, allowing you to replay the file and recreate the system's state before the outage. For less severe cases, such as the failure and recovery of a single Real-Time Subscriber (RTS), you can recover from the Real-Time Database (RDB). This approach works only if the crashed process was an RTS, not the Tickerplant (TP) itself. Additionally, if multiple processes fail simultaneously, recovering from the RDB may put excessive pressure on it, affecting other processes or users relying on real-time data.

This mismatch in pace can lead to the Tickerplant's output queue building up, causing a spike in memory usage, and potentially resulting in the Tickerplant crashing or the server running out of memory. To prevent such scenarios, you can enhance your KDB/Q Tick architecture by introducing a Chained Tickerplant (CTP). A Chained Tickerplant is essentially another Tickerplant positioned after the main Tickerplant, which publishes data in batches based on either the number of messages or a specific time interval. This batching reduces the publishing frequency, allowing slow subscribers to consume messages at a manageable pace.

In the typical plain vanilla tick setup, you have a Real-Time Database (RDB) for intraday data and a Historical Database (HDB) for historical data. However, as data volume grows, it may exceed your server's available memory. To manage this, you can implement an Intraday Writedown Database (WDB), which saves data to disk throughout the day while the RDB holds only the most recent data. This saving process can be triggered by a timer or after a certain number of records. The WDB setup involves two processes: one for saving intraday data to disk and another for querying this saved data from a temporary location. It's crucial to note that the WDB is distinct from the HDB; at the end of the day, the intraday data is merged into the HDB and moved from the temporary location.

To avoid this issue, you could introduce an independent process responsible for saving data to disk. This process would first read data from the Tickerplant Log file into memory and then save it to disk.
