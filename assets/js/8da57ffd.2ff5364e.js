In real systems, processes crash, networks hiccup, and services get overloaded, and the gateway is often the first line of defence against all of that. Instead of blindly forwarding requests, a resilient gateway actively monitors the health of its dependencies and adapts its behaviour when things go wrong. If a primary HDB becomes unavailable, the gateway can transparently route requests to a redundant replica. If an RDB is under heavy load, it may choose to return a degraded but still useful response rather than letting queries pile up and time out. And when no viable option exists, the gateway should fail gracefully, returning clear, informative errors instead of leaving users guessing. This is why robust gateways are typically paired with health checks, heartbeats, and well-defined fallback strategies, not just to keep the system running, but to keep it predictable and user-friendly under failure conditions."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"caching-in-gateways",children:"Caching in Gateways"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"One of the most underappreciated, and often overlooked, enhancements in gateway design is smart caching. A well-placed cache allows the gateway to access or store the results of frequently requested queries and serve them directly without hitting downstream services every single time.

This is especially powerful for predictable or repetitive queries, dashboards, and reference-style lookups where freshness requirements are well understood.

These signals allow you to understand not just whether the system is up, but how it behaves under real load.

This keeps client code simple and decoupled from the underlying data topology. As systems evolve, this aggregation layer becomes increasingly important: new data sources can be introduced, storage formats can change, and legacy services can be retired without breaking consumers.
