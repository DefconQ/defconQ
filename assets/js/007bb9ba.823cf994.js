The database's distinctive approach involves the initial placement of data in in-memory tables, secured by an on-disk log.

Leveraging diverse storage media, such as solid-state drives (SSD) and hard disk drives (HDD), the system provides flexibility for optimizing performance and storage costs. This meticulous process, combining the efficiency of sequential-write operations and immediate data availability, results in orders-of-magnitude performance improvements. Furthermore, the columnar format of the database's table structure facilitates bulk writes to on-disk tables, enhancing the efficiency of data ingestion.
