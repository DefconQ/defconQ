Following an invitation of my friends at [KX](https://kx.com), I joined market participants and other KDB/Q developers for a day full of keynote presentations, real-world use cases of KX products, and engaging networking sessions with fellow KDB/Q enthusiasts. \\n\\nThis summit was one of the standout highlights of the year for me, as I was thrilled to hear about the latest advancements at KX, learn how market participants and industry experts leverage KDB/Q to gain a competitive edge, and see KXperts showcase innovative solutions they\u2019ve been working on. On a personal note, it was also a wonderful opportunity to reconnect with KDB/Q developers I hadn\u2019t seen in a while and catch up with my friends at KX. It\u2019s an event I wouldn\u2019t have missed for the world!\\n\\n![KDB/Q Survival of the Fastest](./vin-diesel-fast-and-furious-racing.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The New KX - Framing the AI Journey In Capital Markets\\n\\nThe summit began with an inspiring keynote session featuring KX CEO [**Ashok Reddy**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/areddy/) and CMO [**Peter Finter**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterfinter/). Ashok took us on a journey through KX\u2019s history, from its founding in 1993 (the same year as Nvidia) to its evolution into the powerhouse it is today. He emphasized KX\u2019s strength, speed, and transformative impact on capital markets, particularly as firms move toward an AI-first future. Highlighting KX\u2019s mission, Ashok stated, ***\u201cOur focus is on the technology problems so you can focus on the business problems.\u201d***  He also introduced the concept of **AI Factories**, emphasising how they empower firms to make high-stakes, data-driven decisions and support quants in leveraging cutting-edge AI.\\n\\n![Ashok Reddy KX](./AshokReddy.jpeg)\\n\\nNext, Peter Finter delivered fascinating insights into the AI landscape. He underscored the critical role AI plays in enabling quants to uncover market patterns, speed up iteration cycles, and transform ideas into action\u2014helping firms maintain their edge in high-speed markets. Peter noted that only ***6% of organizations achieve meaningful ROI from AI***, leaving significant room for growth. His presentation revolved around the powerful mantra: **\u201cSurvival of the Fastest.\u201d** And if speed is the game, KX and KDB/Q undeniably sit at the summit of the data mountain!\\n\\n## Optimising Quantitative Development with KDB: A Case Study in Performance and Scalability with B2C2\\n\\nThe first guest speaker of the day, [**Jad Sarmo**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jad-sarmo-5b2b858/), Head of Quantitative Development at **B2C2**, delivered an insightful session on leveraging a scalable KDB/Q architecture to manage high-volume data and empower quantitative research in the fast-paced crypto space.

This engaging session highlighted how KDB/Q\u2019s robust and scalable architecture revolutionizes quantitative analysis in crypto, offering firms a clear advantage with actionable, rapid insights. \\n\\nA key takeaway from Jad\'s presentation was the emphasis on the importance of high-quality data, highlighting that recent data holds greater significance than data from a decade ago. This is particularly true in financial markets, which continuously evolve over time, unlike other industries.\\n\\n![Jad Sarmo B2C2](./JadSarmo.jpeg)\\n\\n## Frictionless Deployment for Capital Markets: Accelerating Time to Value\\n\\nAfter a brief break and networking session, the day continued with the first panel discussion. [**Adrian Fancourt**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-fancourt-315489/), Head of Capital Markets Business Development, EMEA at **AWS**, joined [**Matt MacLeod**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/themacleod/) from **ICE** and [**Ilija Zovko**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zovko/) from **Aspect Capital** to discuss he challenges faced by capital markets clients in managing data infrastructure. Ilija opened with a candid observation about the difficulty of finding interns who either know KDB/Q or are eager to learn it. My suggestion? Take advantage of the free personal trial edition or the student edition of KDB, offering a year of access that can be easily renewed. For learning KDB/Q, there\u2019s no better place than **DefconQ** - check out my comprehensive study plan [here](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/studyPlan/intro). \\n\\nThe panel explored solutions to help capital markets firms overcome infrastructure management challenges, emphasizing the need for streamlined approaches that enable data teams to focus on generating insights rather than grappling with infrastructure. Together, KX, ICE, and AWS deliver a frictionless deployment model that removes bottlenecks by handling infrastructure setup, normalizing data, and ensuring its immediate availability for analysis. This session highlighted how KX accelerates time to market and value through innovative data management and deployment strategies.\\n\\n![Frictionless Deployment for Capital Markets Panel](./panel.jpeg)\\n\\n## Fixed Income Trading: It\'s More Than About Time \\n\\nNext up was [**Ken Garrett**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-garrett-8328a312/), Head of Fixed Income eTrading at **ING**, delivering what many of my peers considered another highlight of the day. Ken explored how fixed-income trading analytics can go beyond traditional time-series and tick data. He showcased the robust capabilities of KDB and the Q programming language in managing extensive data aggregation, a critical requirement for tackling the multidimensional challenges of trading. This approach is particularly valuable in low-liquidity markets, where conventional tools often struggle. Ken\'s session demonstrated how KDB and Q can enhance data oversight and offer a competitive advantage in complex trading environments.\\n\\n## How PyKX expands access to KX products\\n\\nAfter a short break, which included exclusive solution showcases and 1:1 consultation sessions with KX experts, [**Conor McCarthy**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conor-mccarthy-08aa25a7/), VP of Data Science at **KX**, As the Lead Architect of PyKX, Conor explained what PyKX is (for those unfamiliar) and why it is quickly becoming the gold standard for data access and analysis among KX clients who haven\'t made the transition to pure KDB/Q yet.  He highlighted how recent innovations in PyKX are elevating KX products to new heights in terms of democratization and performance.\\n\\n![Conor McCarthy](./ConorMcCarthy.jpeg)\\n\\nConor showcased exciting new features introduced in version 3.0, emphasizing PyKX\'s hybrid architecture that combines the speed and scale of kdb+ with seamless integration into Python\u2019s ML and deep learning libraries, enabling advanced AI-driven algorithms and analytics workflows. Two standout upgrades were:\\n\\n- **Python-First Query API**: A user-friendly API that unifies fast access to real-time and historical data within Python\u2019s ML environment.\\n- **Python-First Streaming Workflows**: Enables real-time data handling within Python, simplifying the application of ML and AI models to high-frequency data streams. An impressive 95% of tasks can now be performed entirely within Python, reducing the need for extensive programming language expertise.\\n\\nI had the privilege of a personal demo of these new features and must say they make life remarkably easy for Python-first developers. However, as a devoted KDB/Q enthusiast, I have to admit that my preferred language of choice remains, and will always be, KDB/Q.\\n\\nFor more details about PyKX, check out these two press releases and explore the official documentation available on [code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com/pykx/3.0/)\\n\\n- [BigDataWire: KX Aims to Unlock Python\u2019s Potential with PyKX 3.0](https://www.bigdatawire.com/2024/11/14/kx-aims-to-unlock-pythons-potential-with-pykx-3-0/)\\n- [BusinessWire: KX Supercharges Python Workloads with kdb+ Speed and AI/ML Library Integration](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241112167685/en/KX-Supercharges-Python-Workloads-with-kdb-Speed-and-AIML-Library-Integration)\\n\\n![Conor McCarthy Quote](./ConorMcCarthyQuote.jpeg)\\n\\n## Accelerated Computing and Generative AI: Applications in Finance with NVIDIA\\n\\nNext, [**Lavinia Ghita**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lavinia-ghita13/), Senior AI Solutions Architect at **NVDIA**,  explored the natural synergy between KX and NVIDIA\u2014stemming not only from their shared inception year but also from their mutual focus on innovation. Lavinia provided valuable insights into accelerated computing and large language model (LLM) applications in finance and trading, showcasing how these technologies are revolutionizing the industry. Her presentation included an overview of the latest advancements in the field, a detailed examination of practical use cases, and guidance on accessing enterprise-ready accelerated computing infrastructure and resources. The discussion highlighted how AI solutions are transforming capital markets by mapping the journey from traditional applications to advanced AI-driven decision-making, with a focus on:\\n\\n- Opportunities and implementation challenges\\n- Unlocking the full potential of AI\\n- The new AI Factory for Capital Markets and strategies to tackle common AI obstacles.\\n\\n![Lavinia Ghita](./LaviniaGhita.jpeg)\\n\\n## AI beyond the hype \u2013 lessons learnt\\n\\nAfter the final break and networking session, [**Johann Strauss**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/straussjohann/), CTO for AI Pursuit at **Dell Technologies**, delivered what I found to be the most energetic and engaging presentation of the day. Johann highlighted that while headlines often focus on massive investments in \u201cmega clusters\u201d by tech giants, the enterprise market is more concerned with integrating AI into business processes. He addressed the challenges enterprises face in navigating the complex AI landscape, including governance, the sway of \u201crandom vendors\u201d influencing AI projects within business units, and the critical need for predictable costs.\\n\\nJohann emphasized six core capabilities that can address the majority of enterprise AI use cases, encouraging CIOs to prioritize these foundational elements instead of attempting to build an extensive array of capabilities. His presentation focused on the \\"how\\" of implementing AI in the enterprise, advocating for a factory-style approach to drive AI adoption across organizations effectively.\\n\\n## Leading Capital Markets into the AI-First Future\\n\\nTo close out the day, Johann Strauss (Dell), Ken Garrett (ING), Jad Sarmo (B2C2), and KX CEO Ashok Reddy shared the stage for a thought-provoking panel discussion on how capital markets firms can achieve an AI-first future.\\n\\n![Leading Capital Markets into the AI-First Future](./finalPanel.jpeg)\\n\\nFollowing the insightful session, attendees were treated to a cocktail reception that rounded off the event in style. The highlight of the evening? A magician who captivated the crowd with mind-blowing tricks, leaving even [Data Intellect](https://dataintellect.com) CTO [**Jonny Press**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonny-press-7005602/) utterly speechless. It was the perfect finale to an incredible day.\\n\\n\\nI looking forward to the next KX event! Until then, happy coding!"},{"id":"NYSE extends trading hours","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/NYSE extends trading hours","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-29-nyse/index.md","title":"New York Stock Exchange extends trading hours","description":"Last week, in a groundbreaking move, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) revealed plans to extend after-hours trading on its Arca electronic exchange.

This development follows other major exchange announcements this year, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE Group), backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities. To learn more about how these changes could reshape the electronic trading landscape, keep reading below.\\n\\n![NYSE extends trading hours](./nyse.png)\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Plan\\n\\nFirst things first, let\'s examine the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s (NYSE) latest proposal. On Friday, the NYSE announced its plans to extend trading hours on its all-electronic Arca exchange to 22 hours a day.\\n\\nThis proposal aligns with growing interest in around-the-clock trading in U.S. markets. Robinhood, for example, introduced \u201c24/5 trading\u201d in May 2023, allowing trades from 8 p.m. ET on Sundays to 8 p.m. ET on Fridays. Meanwhile, global cryptocurrency markets already operate 24/7.\\n\\nUnder the new plan, NYSE Arca\u2019s trading would open at 1:30 a.m. and close at 11:30 p.m. ET on weekdays, pending regulatory approval, according to the NYSE\u2019s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange. Currently, extended trading hours on the NYSE range from 4 a.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET, with regular trading between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. ET.\\n\\nNYSE Arca, a leading platform for trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and over 8,000 U.S.-listed securities, would allow trading of all U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and closed-end funds during these expanded hours.\\n\\nThe proposal comes in response to rising demand for U.S. securities trading. Kevin Tyrrell, Head of Markets at the New York Stock Exchange, commented, \\"The NYSE\u2019s initiative to extend U.S. equity trading to 22 hours a day, five days a week highlights the strength of our U.S. capital markets and the increasing global demand for our listed securities. As the steward of U.S. capital markets, the NYSE is proud to lead the way in providing exchange-based trading access to our U.S.-listed companies and funds for investors across global time zones.\\"\\n\\n## Redefining the Game: What NYSE\'s 22-Hour Trading Means for Electronic Markets\\n\\nWhat will these extended trading hours mean for the electronic trading landscape? Opinions are divided. While some market participants believe the impact will be limited and consider the proposal premature. Jim Toes, CEO of the Security Traders Association, noted in a CNBC interview, \\"The application seems very premature, as the demand for overnight and weekend exchange trading is still speculative.\\" Dmitri Galinov, former head of Credit Suisse\u2019s dark pool, holds a different view. \u201cThere is certainly demand from international markets, especially in South Korea, Japan, and parts of Europe,\u201d he stated in a Sunday interview with CNBC.\\n\\nHe also pointed out a growing interest among U.S. retail traders who wish to trade at night, noting, \u201cMany retail traders work during the day and want the option to trade past the current 8 p.m. cutoff when they get home.\u201d\\n\\nWhile demand from retail traders for extended hours is evident, the key question remains: will institutional traders follow suit? Although institutional investors are unlikely to be early adopters, and trading volumes are expected to be thin initially, competition around extended trading hours is undoubtedly intensifying. Earlier this year, TXSE Group, backed by BlackRock (BLK.N) and Citadel Securities, announced plans to launch the Texas Stock Exchange in Dallas, challenging the dominance of New York-based exchanges in an effort to attract global firms. With Citadel Securities\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest market makers\u2014supporting TXSE, automation and extended trading hours appear increasingly likely, broadening stock market access.\\n\\n## Shifting the Clock: How Extended Hours are Transforming the Trading Tech Landscape\\n\\nFor software developers and engineers in the financial industry focused on trading implications, the consequences are clear: trading data volumes are poised to grow even larger. Today, we already manage unprecedented amounts of data and information, the highest in human history. While this increase in data and trading volume is a natural outcome of technological evolution, extended trading hours are likely to accelerate this growth. As financial technologists, we must adjust and adapt, prioritizing the availability and stability of our trading applications to meet these expanding demands.\\n\\n## KDB/Q: The Definitive Solution for Data-Driven Finance\\n\\nThe next steps in response to this increase in trading volume and the corresponding rise in trading data and information are in your hands. You need to pivot toward technologies designed for big data that can manage substantial amounts of information for both real-time processing and historical data storage. Additionally, rapid computation and calculation are crucial for processing and analyzing the vast amounts of data you\u2019re capturing. What better technology for this than KDB/Q? KDB/Q is the established go-to solution for handling, storing, processing, and analyzing big data and time series data.\\n \\n## Next Steps\\n\\nSo, what are your next steps? It\'s clear that learning KDB/Q can provide you with a significant competitive advantage, especially if you\u2019re starting from scratch. Luckily, I\u2019ve just released the most comprehensive KDB/Q study plan ever created.

I attended Quant Strats purely out of my passion and interest in Quantitative Finance and related topics. I frequently participate in meet-ups, conferences, presentations, and workshops focused on finance, quantitative finance, technology, FinTech, and crypto, driven by curiosity and enthusiasm. After all, it\u2019s the field I work in.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nLast week, I had the opportunity to attend [QuantStrats 2024](https://www.alphaevents.com/events-quantstratsuk) in London, one of the most highly anticipated quantitative finance conferences of the year. After a successful debut in New York last year, QuantStrats made its first appearance in the heart of the City of London, one of the world\u2019s most historic financial hubs. While I\'m sure you\'re eager to hear about the discussions, this post won\u2019t be a recap of the event. Instead, I\u2019ll focus on what made QuantStrats such a standout conference and why you should consider attending in the future if you get the chance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Content\\n\\nQuantStrats featured an impressive variety of topics centered around quantitative finance, including alpha generation, risk management, portfolio optimization, and the application of generative AI in finance. A major focus of the conference was, unsurprisingly, data. With more data available today than ever before, discussions revolved around how to select, onboard, and extract maximum value from it, and how to make informed decisions based on that data. This led to presentations on AI, machine learning, NLP, and large language models (LLMs), exploring how these technologies can not only unlock value from data but also where and how they can add the most impact to an organization.\\n\\nGiven recent political and geopolitical developments\u2014including two major ongoing wars and upcoming elections\u2014another key theme was how to navigate the current macroeconomic landscape, protect assets, and continue generating alpha.\\n\\nThe third major topic of the conference was digital assets and crypto, focusing on how to leverage the digital assets space to diversify or hedge portfolios.\\n\\nThe presentations at QuantStrats were of the highest quality, thanks not only to the exceptional lineup of speakers\u2014industry leaders from top-tier investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, and research institutions\u2014but also to the careful curation of content. This was overseen by a specially formed advisory board, which included some of the most prominent names in finance. Among them were **Michael Steliaros**, Global Head of Portfolio Engineering and Trading at ADIA; **Professor Petter Kolm** from NYU; **Sameer Gupta**, Head of Data Solutions at Point72; **Matt Greenwood**, CIO of Two Sigma; **Anthony Ledford**, Chief Scientist at Man AHL; **Stefan Zohren**, Deputy Director of the Oxford-Man Institute; **Florian Ielpo**, Head of Macro and Multi-Asset Portfolio Manager at Lombard Odier Investment; and **Nicole Koenigstein**, Chief Data Scientist and Head of AI & Quantitative Research at Wyden Capital.\\n\\nMoreover, the conference never felt like a sales pitch. The presentations and content were entirely professional and focused on practical insights. There was just one brief session, structured as a series of five-minute elevator pitches, where five companies introduced or showcased how their data offerings, platforms, software, or tools could provide a competitive edge in the market. But that was the extent of it.\\n\\n## Speakers\\n\\nThe speaker lineup at QuantStrats was just as impressive as the content. With over 50 experts from leading institutions across the industry, the conference truly stood out. These professionals, with years\u2014if not decades\u2014of hands-on experience, covered a broad range of topics including Data and Data Sourcing, AI, ML, NLP, and LLMs, Portfolio and Risk Management, Alpha Generation and Portfolio Construction, Alternative Data and Investments, Crypto, and both Micro and Macro Economics. Together, they explored current trends, anticipated future developments, and addressed the most pressing challenges in the field. \\n\\nThe conference began with keynote speakers and panel discussions in the main room, while the afternoon sessions were split into different streams and tracks based on attendees\u2019 interests. At times, the abundance of excellent speakers and presentations reminded me of being at one of the many electronic dance music (EDM) festivals I attend when I\u2019m not blogging about KDB/Q\u2014where you have to prioritize and choose between your favorite DJs and headliners due to overlapping set times. Similarly, at QuantStrats, I often faced tough decisions, having to pick one presentation over another. But that\'s certainly a good problem to have!\\n\\nSome of the notable speakers included:\\n\\n- **Michael Steliaros**, Global Head of Portfolio Engineering and Trading, ADIA\\n- **Laura Serban**, Managing Director, AQR\\n- **Alex Remorov**, Director, Systematic Active Equities, BlackRock\\n- **James Munro**, Head of ArcticDB, Man Group\\n- **Joe Hanmer**, Global Head of Quant, Fidelity International\\n- **Mark Fleming-Williams**, Head of Data Sourcing, Capital Fund Management\\n- **Kimiya Minoukadeh**, Director - Head of eFX Quants, ING\\n- **Hamza Bahaji**, Head of Financial Engineering, Amundi Asset Management\\n- **Amadeo Alentorn**, Head of Systematic Equities, Jupiter Asset Management\\n- **Justin Xu**, Managing Director, Head of Risk, Millennium Global Investments\\n- **Marc Vesecky**, Senior Managing Director of Global Quantitative Strategies, Variation Fund Management\\n- **Alessandro Balata**, Fasanara Capital\\n- **Barry Fitzgerald**, Co-Head of Front Office Engineering, Man Group\\n- **Prasad Shinde**, Lead Specialist - UK, I & MENA, KX ...and many more. \\n\\n## Attendees\\n\\nThe attendees at QuantStrats were equally impressive. With over 75% of the audience coming from both the buy-side and sell-side, the event truly lived up to its reputation and sparked fascinating discussions. It brought together participants from all corners of the industry, and the excitement and engagement in the buzzing rooms were tangible. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals in the quant space, exchanging ideas on the latest trends, challenges, and solutions in the field. Regardless of experience or seniority, everyone was friendly, open, and approachable. I even had an interesting conversation during the lunch break with Aric Whitewood, CEO of XAI Asset Management, and David Mascio, one of the speakers. Attendees represented some of the biggest names in the industry, including but not limited to firms like **Winton, Goldman Sachs, ADIA, Marshall Wace, Aspect Capital, Two Sigma, BlackRock, Man Group, Citadel, BlueCrest, Point72, JPMorgan, Jupiter, Balyasny Asset Management, AQR, KX, and many more**.\\n\\n## Organisation\\n\\nAside from the outstanding lineup of speakers and presentations, the second most impressive aspect of QuantStrats was its flawless organization. The entire day flowed seamlessly. From arrival and registration to coordination and setup, everything was executed perfectly. The venue was carefully chosen to comfortably accommodate nearly 300 attendees. Even during the morning keynote sessions and panel discussions in the main room, it never felt crowded\u2014there was plenty of space for everyone. The stage was visible from all angles, and audio monitors and screens ensured that everyone could see and hear the presentations clearly. The smaller breakout rooms for the afternoon sessions were just as well-equipped as the main hall.\\n\\nAfter the individual afternoon presentations, the conference wrapped up with four interactive roundtable discussions, which added a refreshing, engaging touch.\\n\\nOne standout feature of the event was the app provided for the conference. Not only did it include the floor plan, agenda, and a list of all speakers and attendees, but it also offered detailed attendee profiles. You could filter by name, company, or interest, and the app even matched your interests with those of other attendees, making it easy to find common ground. You could connect with others, schedule meetings, and communicate via in-app messaging. For privacy, this was fully customizable according to your preferences.\\n\\nAs a final bonus, the slides and presentation decks were made available in the app after the conference. Overall, the organization was truly top-notch. While I\u2019ve attended well-organized events before, this one set a new benchmark, raising the bar for conference standards.\\n\\nIt wasn\'t all about work\u2014there was plenty of time to socialize, network, and enjoy the refreshments available during the three breaks throughout the day. A one-hour lunch break, featuring a healthy meal, gave everyone the chance to recharge and approach the afternoon sessions with renewed energy. In the evening, a reception and networking drinks provided the perfect opportunity to wrap up the conference in a relaxed and engaging atmosphere.\\n\\n![Quant Strats App Screen](./QuantStratsApp.jpg)\\n\\n## Cost and ROI (Return on Investment)\\n\\nNow that we\u2019ve covered all the great aspects of QuantStrats, let\u2019s talk about the price.

In this blog post, I want to share my tips on how to best prepare for an interview and boost your chances of landing your dream job.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Before the Interview\\n\\n![How to Successfully Prepare for an Interview and Land Your Dream Job](./success.png)\\n\\n### Crafting Your CV \u2013 Your Ultimate Professional Business Card\\n\\nTo land a job interview, you first need to clear the initial hurdle: the CV review. Whether you apply directly or through a recruiter, your CV will be the first thing evaluated. To ensure you get past this stage and make it to the interview, here are a few tips to help you pass the CV review:\\n\\n1. **Short and Catchy**: Just like writing efficient KDB/Q code, your CV should be terse. Keep it to one A4 page. No matter how many internships or roles you\'ve had, only include the most relevant ones. Even senior developers manage to keep it to one page, and so can you.\\n2. **Tailored Like a Suit**: Your CV should be like a good suit: *Tailored*. While having a general CV is fine when starting your job search, it\'s better to customize it for each role. Highlight relevant skills and achievements, aligning them with the job requirements. This will make your CV stand out and help recruiters see if you\'re a match for the position.\\n\\nThings **NOT** to do when writing your CV:\\n1. **Don\'t Lie:** This should go without saying, but never exaggerate or fabricate skills or experiences. You\'ll likely get caught during the interview, and even if you don\'t, it will eventually catch up with you.\\n2. **Avoid Unnecessary Details:** Skip the headshot and your age. These details aren\'t necessary and can detract from your qualifications. Keep the focus on your skills and experience.\\n\\n## Preparation: the Key to a Successful Job Application\\n\\nAs the Japanese proverb goes, \\"Better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.\\" The same applies to job applications\u2014you want to be as prepared as possible. Here are a few tips to help you get ready for success.\\n\\n### The Role\\n\\nThe best way to succeed in a job application is to gather as much information as possible about the role you\'re applying for. This not only ensures you\'re a good fit, but also helps you determine if the role aligns with your expectations and career goals. Start early by carefully reading the job description and asking the recruiter for more details before your first interview. This will help you prepare effectively. Once you\'re in the interview process, keep asking relevant questions to the hiring manager, interviewers, and potential team members. Remember, interviews are a two-way street. While the company is assessing your skills, you should also evaluate if the role and workplace are right for you.\\n\\n### Technical Preparation: Master the Art of Showcasing Your Skill\\n\\nThe key to landing your dream job is, of course, having the right skill set for the role. While you may already possess most or all of the required skills, it\u2019s important to prepare and refresh your knowledge before the interview. Often in your current role, you focus on specific tasks and might not need the broader knowledge that an interview demands. During the interview process, you\'ll likely be questioned on a wide range of topics across multiple sessions, so it\'s crucial to review and sharpen your technical skills.\\n\\nThe depth of technical questioning typically depends on the level of the role. For junior to mid-level positions, interviews tend to focus on hands-on programming experience. For senior roles, however, you\u2019ll need to demonstrate knowledge in architecture, software design, and building or extending applications. Ensuring you\'re comfortable with these topics will greatly enhance your chances of success.\\n\\n**Pro tip**: Be prepared for live coding. It\u2019s a common practice to be asked to demonstrate your skills in real-time, so make sure you\'re ready for this aspect of the interview. Although preparing for KDB/Q live coding is a bit more challenging, many big FAANG tech companies often use [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) for their coding challenges. If you\'re interviewing at one of these companies, I highly recommend practicing [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems to sharpen your skills.\\n\\n### Emotional Quotient (EQ): Social Skills\\n\\nWhile the technical aspect is the main focus of any software developer or engineering interview, your social skills and emotional intelligence (EQ) are equally important. After all, you\'ll be spending around eight hours a day at work, making it crucial for the hiring manager to find someone who fits well with the team culture and can collaborate effectively. Not everyone is an extrovert, and many of us prefer working independently, but emotional intelligence can be developed, at least to some degree. Here are a few tips to help you feel more comfortable and socially engaged:\\n\\n1. Attend (tech) meetups and interact with new people.\\n2. If you\'re into sports, join a club or any type of group activity.\\n3. Use your current job as a \\"practice field\\" for improving your social skills\u2014go to team drink or organize activities with coworkers, and make an effort to socialize with colleagues outside your immediate team.\\n\\n## Effectice strategies to boost your success rate\\n\\nAcing interviews is a skill in itself. I\u2019ve met many talented software engineers who struggle under the pressure of an interview, while others, who may be less technical, have mastered the art of interviewing and excel in those situations. Fortunately for you, I\u2019m sharing my top strategies to boost your chances of landing your dream job.\\n\\n### Practice! After all, practice makes mastery\\n\\nLike any other skill, practice leads to mastery, and interviews are no exception. The more interviews you do, the better you\u2019ll become over time. However, unlike other skills, interviews aren\u2019t something you typically practice for. So how can you improve? Just like mock exams help with exam prep, you can create mock interview scenarios. Put yourself in the position of a hiring manager and think about what questions you\u2019d ask a candidate. Then, try answering them yourself.\\n\\nOf course, this is far less stressful than a real interview, so a better option is to ask a friend (most developers have developer friends) or an ex-colleague to give you a mock interview. You could also apply for roles you\'re not interested in, just to gain interview experience. However, take this advice with a pinch of salt. You don\u2019t want to risk damaging your reputation by underperforming or turning down offers after a successful interview. For mainstream developer roles, practicing LeetCode challenges is another great way to sharpen your skills before the actual interview.\\n\\n### Don\'t put all your eggs into one basket\\n\\nIf you\'ve worked in finance, you\'re likely familiar with the concept of diversification. The same principle can be applied to your job search. To improve your chances of landing a role, apply for multiple positions. However, diversification has diminishing returns, so it\u2019s wise to limit your applications to three to five at a time. This allows you to focus your time and energy on each application, boosting the likelihood of success.\\n\\n### A penny for your thoughts - Share your thought process\\n\\nDuring technical interviews, it can be difficult for the interviewer to follow your thought process if you don\u2019t explain it. Let me clarify: Imagine you\'ve been asked to write a program to calculate the next Fibonacci number in a sequence. You take a moment, solve the problem, and give an answer - whether correct or not. Without explaining your reasoning, the interviewer has no insight into how you approached the problem, how you think, or where you may have gone wrong.\\n\\nA much better approach is to \\"think out loud\\" and walk the interviewer through your solution. For example, if asked to write a function that returns the next number in a Fibonacci sequence, you could explain your thought process step-by-step:\\n\\n\u201cIn a Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Given a list of numbers `x`, we need to take the last two elements using `-2#x`. Then, we sum them using the `sum` operator, and finally, append this result to the end of the list using the concatenate operator `,`. So, the solution is `{x,sum -2#x}`.\\"\\n\\nThis approach not only demonstrates your problem-solving skills but also gives the interviewer a chance to guide you if you\u2019re on the wrong track, especially with more complex questions.\\n\\n### Situational Questions - Shine with the S.T.A.R appraoch\\n\\nEvery interview contains at least a couple of situational questions: questions about how you behave in certain situations and how you overcome certain problems you might face. Answering these kind of interview questions can sometimes be tricky, especially for a more technical minded person. One way how to approach these questions is to remember the S.T.A.R approach: Situation, Task, Action and Result. First describe the Situation you have been in, what was the context or environment around you like. Next, explain the Task you were given, then proceed to explaining the Actions you have taken and finally explain the Result you achieved. This approach gives you a clear guideline to structure and communicate your answer\\n\\n### Beware: Over-Preparing with Interview Questions Can Backfire\\n\\nWhile preparation is key and practice makes mastery, avoid over-relying on sample interview questions. Memorizing specific answers can be limiting. If you face a slightly different question, you might struggle to adapt. Instead, focus on deeply understanding the underlying concepts and how to apply them to various problems. This will give you the flexibility to tackle any question, even if it differs from what you\u2019ve practiced.\\n\\n## Interview Don\'ts - What NOT to do\\n\\nAlong with the strategies to boost your chances of landing a job, there are also a few things you should avoid doing.\\n\\n### Don\'t Lie\\n\\nJust like with your CV, I strongly believe you should never lie during a job interview\u2014whether it\u2019s about your past experiences, skills, certifications, or anything else. Eventually, the truth will catch up, and it could severely damage your reputation, marking you as untrustworthy.\\n\\n### Be Honest: Don\'t Fabricate Answers \u2013 No One Knows it All\\n\\nThere may come a time during an interview when you\'re unsure of the answer to a question. I\'ve been in these situations myself, and I prefer to admit that I don\u2019t know or am unsure, rather than guessing or, worse, fabricating an answer. Admitting you don\u2019t know shows honesty and integrity. As someone who\u2019s interviewed candidates, I\u2019d much rather see someone admit they\u2019re unsure than catch them in a fabricated answer, which is a major red flag and usually leads to a \\"no hire.\\" Here\'s a tip: there\u2019s a better way to admit uncertainty. Instead of just saying \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d explain how you would approach finding the answer or where you would look. This can make a big difference.\\n\\n## \xa0After the Interview: What to Do Next\\n\\n### Patience\\n\\nOnce your interview is over, there\'s not much you can do except be patient and wait for feedback. I know it\u2019s easier said than done, and I\u2019m not the most patient person myself, but since you\'re likely not the only candidate, it may take the hiring manager a few days to respond. Just remember, until you hear otherwise, you\'re still in the game.\\n\\n### Keep Preparing: Stay Ahead of the Game\\n\\nMost roles you\'ll apply for will involve multiple rounds of interviews, so it\'s unlikely you\'ll only have one. After your first interview, continue preparing for the next round. Reflect on how it went: What questions were asked? What did you do well? Where could you improve? This self-review will help you gear up for future interviews, as it\u2019s rare to face the same questions again. If you were unsure about certain topics, revisit them so you\'re more confident for the next round.\\n\\n### Turning Setbacks into Success: What to Do if the Interview Didn\u2019t Go Your Way\\n\\nSometimes, we have to face setbacks, and not receiving the job offer you wanted can be frustrating. However, you have two options: 1. Stay upset and do nothing, or 2. Take a moment to process the disappointment, then reflect on how to improve for the next opportunity. Remember, it might not always be about you; sometimes a more suitable candidate simply comes along. Ask the hiring manager or recruiter for feedback on your performance and areas to improve. There\u2019s always a chance the company will have future openings, and you can reapply with the lessons you\u2019ve learned.\\n\\n### Happily Ever After: When Your Interview was Successful\\n\\nCongratulations! You\'ve done it! Your hard work paid off, and you\'ve received a job offer. Take a moment to celebrate and be proud of your achievement. Now it\'s time to handle the formalities of accepting the offer and preparing for your new role. Well done!\\n\\n## Bonus Tip\\n\\nAlways keep in mind that an interview is a two-way process. While the company is evaluating whether you\'re the right fit and if your skill set aligns with their needs, you should also assess if the role is truly what you\'re looking for. Consider whether the hiring manager or technical lead is someone you\'d enjoy working with and if the team has a positive culture where you can grow, learn, and develop. Remember, taking on a new role is a commitment, and ideally, you\'ll want to stay in that position for at least a few years before considering your next move.\\n\\n## Top Resources to Ace your Next Interview\\n\\n- [Go-To KDB/Q Learning Resources](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources)\\n- [Advanced KDB/Q Learning Material](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/Advanced%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Material)\\n- [The Plain Vanilla Tick Setup](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/architecture/plain)\\n- [DefconQ Important KDB/Q Concepts](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/category/important-concepts)\\n- [DefconQ Tickerplant Walkthrough](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/category/tutorials)"},{"id":"Happy Birthday DefconQ","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Happy Birthday DefconQ","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-04-HappyBirthday/index.mdx","title":"Happy Birthday DefconQ","description":"One year ago, on my birthday, I launched DefconQ \u2014 a KDB/Q-focused blog aimed at helping developers and KDB/Q newcomers enhance their skills or get started with the language.

Over the past year, I\'ve shared **26** pieces of content (including this one) on my blog, ranging from blog posts to learning materials. While some pieces took more time to create than others, I\'ve maintained an average of publishing new content every two weeks. For me, this consistency is a significant achievement. While some posts were less technical than others, I believe that most of them added value in one way or another. This is reflected in the website traffic, as shown in the Google Analytics report below.\\n\\n![DefconQ Google Analytics Page Views](./pageViews.png)\\n![DefconQ Google Analytics Page Views Breakdown](./breakdown.png)\\n\\nAs the breakdown shows, DefconQ received over **30,000 views** from **5,223 visitors** in the past year. The most popular posts were [The Plain Vanilla Tick Setup](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/architecture/plain), [KDB Tick Explained: A Walkthrough](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/tutorials/tick), and [Go-To KDB/Q Learning Resources](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources).\\n\\n### Reach\\n\\nA closely related metric I was particularly interested in is the actual reach of **DefconQ**. Since most updates are posted from my personal [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderunterrainer/) account, DefconQ\'s standalone reach doesn\'t fully capture the overall impact. Therefore, I\'ve included both my personal reach and DefconQ\'s reach in this analysis. We already know that the DefconQ blog attracted over **5,000** visitors last year. Now, let\'s take a closer look at the demographics of these visitors.\\n\\n![DefconQ Google Analytics Users by Country](./UserByCountry.png)\\n![DefconQ Google Analytics Users by City](./UserByCity.png)\\n\\nIt\'s no surprise that the United Kingdom and the United States are the predominant countries, with London and New York being the cities with the most users. However, what comes as a surprise is the fact that even smaller countries or countries where KDB/Q is traditionally not present showed interest in DefconQ. Such countries include Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile,Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Norway, Sweden, Finland or China, among others.\\n\\n![Alexander Unterrainer Linkedin Impressions](./impressions.png)\\n\\nAlthough my LinkedIn account generated nearly 200k impressions over the past year, with top-performing posts averaging around 6-7k impressions each, I\u2019m not a huge fan of this metric because it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate engagement. LinkedIn defines impressions as the number of times a post is visible for at least 300 milliseconds, with at least 50 percent of the post in view on a signed-in member\u2019s device or browser window ([Source: LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a564051/content-analytics-for-your-linkedin)). However, considering that roughly 10,000 people list KDB/Q as one of their skills on LinkedIn, it\u2019s quite impressive that my posts reach about two-thirds of them.\\n\\n![Alexander Unterrainer Linkedin Impressions Top Posts](./topPosts.png)\\n\\n### Followers\\n\\nOver the past year, **DefconQ** gained **434** followers on LinkedIn\u2014a modest number, likely due to the fact that I primarily share updates from my personal account rather than the [DefconQ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/defconq/) page. Since most of my KDB/Q network is connected to my personal profile, it made sense to post updates there to reach a broader audience. However, if you\'re reading this and don\'t yet follow [DefconQ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/defconq/) on LinkedIn, I encourage you to head over and give it a follow [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/defconq/)!\\n\\n### Meetup and Conferences\\n\\n#### Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q by [Habla Computing](https://hablapps.com)\\n\\nAfter attending a KDB/Q Meetup in Madrid this past January, where I had the pleasure of meeting [Juan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jserranohidalgo/) and [Jesus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jes\xfas-l\xf3pez-gonz\xe1lez-98237248/) from [Habla Computing](https://hablapps.com), I was invited to present at their upcoming inaugural KDB/Q Meetup titled \\"Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q,\\" a series designed to promote KDB/Q in Spain. This was my first public speaking engagement as a KDB/Q professional, and it was a great success. I had the honor of presenting alongside renowned peers like [Rebecca Kelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyr13/) and [Aoife Clarke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aoife-clarke-638188136/) from [INQDATA](https://www.inqdata.ai),  as well as my colleague [Zan Buchanan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zan-buchanan-33b5a8148/) from [Data Intellect](https://dataintellect.com). My presentation, [How to Read, Understand, and Learn KDB/Q code](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/How%20to%20Read,%20Understand%20and%20Learn%20KDB/Q%20code) was well-received by the audience. For those who couldn\'t attend the meetup, the recording is available for review [here](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/DefconQ%20at%20Everything,%20Everywhere,%20All%20with%20KDB/Q%20by%20Habla%20Computing).\\n\\n#### KX Meetup in London\\n\\nAfter my first public appearance in Madrid, I was honored to be invited by [KX](https://kx.com) to participate in a panel discussion at the KX Meetup in London. Joining Andrew Wilson and [Conor McCarthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conor-mccarthy-08aa25a7/) \u2014 two highly experienced KDB/Q developers working on key components of the KX ecosystem\u2014on a panel moderated by [Michaela Woods](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaela-woods-50502b60/) was an incredible experience. We discussed the latest advancements in [PyKX](https://code.kx.com/pykx/2.5/), the updates introduced in KDB/Q version 4.1, and the growth and future of the KDB/Q community.\\n\\n#### Iverson College 2024\\n\\nAfter a six-year break, [Iverson College](https://iversoncollege.com), organized by the well-known [Stephen Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/), made its return to Trinity Hall in Cambridge this summer. Iverson College is a residential event for array programming enthusiasts to explore and discuss topics related to vector programming languages. This year\u2019s conference featured an incredibly impressive lineup of [participants](https://iversoncollege.com/participants/), including both language implementers and developers. The wealth of experience, knowledge, and expertise present made this a truly unique experience for me and one of the standout highlights of this year\'s KDB/Q events.\\n\\n### Livestreams and Podcasts\\n\\n#### Mastering KBD/Q Architecture: DefconQ meets KX\\n\\n[KX](https://kx.com), along with the KXperts team led by [Michaela Woods](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaela-woods-50502b60/), has begun hosting livestreams as part of the revamp of their KX Academy. For their second episode, I had the pleasure of joining Michaela and [Cynthia Faus Viad\xe9](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthiafaus/) to discuss KDB/Q Architecture. I believe this is a fantastic initiative to spread KDB/Q knowledge and connect with a broader audience, as the livestreams are accessible from anywhere in the world. If you missed the livestream, no worries! I\'ve written a detailed summary [here](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/DefconQ%20meets%20KX%20-%20Mastering%20KDB+%20Architecture%20-%20A%20Panel%20Discussion), which also includes the recording of the discussion.\\n\\n#### DefconQ meets Fancy Quant\\n\\nAnother new milestone for DefconQ was joining the seasoned podcaster and YouTuber [Dimitri Bianco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-bianco/) on his [Fancy Quant - Talking Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/@DimitriBianco) podcast. Dimitri and I had an in-depth conversation about all things KDB/Q and Quant finance. We discussed why KDB/Q is so prevalent in the financial industry and what makes it an excellent choice for building applications. We also covered how to kickstart a career in Quant Finance, which degrees and universities are relevant, how to advance in your career, and even debated the pros and cons of living in a big city versus a more remote location. Dimitri is a fantastic host, and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. The podcast touches on a broad range of topics, not just KDB/Q. If you\'re interested in Quantitative Finance or KDB/Q, this episode is a must-listen. Don\'t forget to follow [Dimitri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-bianco/) and [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderunterrainer/) for more insights!\\n\\n[DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - podcast](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/DefconQ%20meets%20Fancy%20Quant%20-%20Alexander%20Unterrainer%20and%20Dimitri%20Bianco%20discuss%20KDB/Q)\\n\\n#### ArrayCast\\n\\nThe stellar lineup at [Iverson College 2024](https://iversoncollege.com), which included [ArrayCast](https://www.arraycast.com) host [Conor Hoekstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorhoekstra/) and nearly all the regular panelists - [Stephen Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/), [Ad\xe1m Brudzewsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrudz/) and Bob Therriault - made it the perfect setting to record an episode of ArrayCast in the historic halls of Trinity College, Cambridge. This also gave me the exciting opportunity to make my debut on the ArrayCast podcast as one of the many participants in this special episode. You can listen to the full episode [here](https://www.arraycast.com/episodes/episode87-iversonsession) If you\'re interested in Array Programming Languages, [ArrayCast](https://www.arraycast.com) is **THE** podcast to follow, so be sure to check it out!\\n\\n### Collaborations \\n\\n#### Q201\\n\\nAt the start of this year, I received a somewhat unexpected email from [Stephen Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/) - an APL and KDB/Q enthusiast and the former librarian of the official KX documentation, a developer who hardly needs an introduction in the KDB/Q community. Stephen shared details about his latest project, [Q201](https://q201.org), an initiative aimed at teaching and explaining KDB/Q at a deep technical and language level. He was also looking to engage more with the KDB/Q community by hosting online workshops and tutoring sessions for interested students. After discovering my blog, Stephen invited me to contribute to his project\u2014a request I was honored to accept. How could I possibly turn down such an esteemed invitation? Since then, I\u2019ve been assisting Stephen with reviewing the content of Q201, providing feedback on areas that might need more detail, and helping to host and coordinate several online workshops with different students. I really enjoy working on this project because it offers a different approach from mine and deepens my understanding of KDB/Q. I highly recommend Q201 to anyone interested in KDB/Q.\\n\\n### Certificates and Awards\\n\\n#### KXperts\\n\\nOne of my proudest moments this year was being recognized by KX as the first KDB/Q developer to receive the \\"Black Tier,\\" the highest level in their KXpert Advocacy Program, for my work with DefconQ. This award is not only a significant honor but also the ultimate validation hat the content I create is making a valuable impact on the KDB/Q Community. If you\'re interested in learning more about the KXpert Advocacy Program and how to get involved, you can read about it in my blog post [here](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/KXperts%20-%20A%20Developer%20Advocacy%20Program%20by%20KX) \\n\\n### Reader\'s Feedback\\n\\nThe most rewarding achievement, however, is the overwhelmingly positive feedback I receive from my blog readers. It\'s incredibly fulfilling when a stranger reaches out to thank me for the content I share, expressing how my blog posts have been helpful or inspirational. That kind of feedback is truly amazing and one of my biggest motivations to continue doing what I do. Here are a few highlights of the feedback I\'ve received over the past year.\\n\\n![Alexander Unterrainer DefconQ Recognitions](./recognition.png)\\n\\n## What the Future holds\\n\\nAfter reflecting on the milestones DefconQ has achieved over the past year, I\'d like to take this final section to look ahead at what\'s in store for the future. Obviously, I\'ll continue to post content in the form of blog posts, technical articles, podcasts, and livestreams. I also plan to keep participating in conferences and meet-ups. However, there are some new initiatives on the horizon, including in-person events for my blog readers, KDB/Q developers, and aspiring KDB/Q professionals. While I can\'t reveal all the exciting projects just yet, I can share that I\'ll be hosting an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session soon. In this AMA, I\'ll answer all your questions about KBD/Q\u2014how to learn it, advance your career, break into the KDB/Q world, or anything else you\'d like to know.

You will learn how to \\n\\n- Customize architecture by adding data feeds and feedhandlers\\n- Implement custom streaming analytics for real time analysis\\n- Use logging to prevent data loss in the event of system failures\\n- Understand and develop custom end of day behavior\\n- Build advanced data retrieval and setting up query gateways\\n\\nThe course is designed for both, KDB/Q developers and non KDB/Q developers, even though experience with KDB/Q will benefit you and additional learning resources are made available to you throughout the course to deepen your knowledge. The course leverages a dedicated sandbox provided by KX and you don\'t even need to install KDB/Q locally but you can run everything within the [KX Learning Hub](https://learninghub.kx.com/academy/)\\n\\n### The Plain Vanilla setup\\n\\nAs part of the live stream, we also briefly discussed the plain vanilla tick setup. For those unfamiliar with this architecture, a KDB/Q tick setup, in its simplest form, includes a Data Feed, a Feed Handler (FH), the Tickerplant (TP), a real-time subscriber, the Real-Time Database (RDB), and a Historical Database (HDB). If you\'re interested in learning more about this setup, I have written a detailed blog post here:\\n- [The Plain Vanilla Tick Setup](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/architecture/plain).\\n\\n### Derived Analytics\\n\\nDerived Analytics can take the form of Complex Event Processing (CEP) or Real-Time Engines (RTE) and are tailored processes designed to perform real-time analytics to support business needs. These processes are highly customized and vary depending on the specific use case. Examples include, but are not limited to, Surveillance Analytics, Trade Cost Analysis (TCA), Price Impact Analysis, Data Quality checks, Hit Ratio calculations, Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP). CEPs are well-defined processes that determine what data to subscribe to, what analytics to perform, whether to persist the data to disk, and whether to publish the data to other Real-Time Subscribers (RTS). Developing a CEP requires a shift in mindset, as the challenges faced are often more complex than those encountered in other processes.\\n\\n### Load Balancing & Gateways\\n\\nIntroducing a Gateway (GW) and/or Load Balancer (LB) to your plain vanilla tick setup is a significant enhancement. A Gateway serves as the main entry point for end users, who typically don\'t know where your data resides or is stored on disk. Since users are generally unaware of whether the RDB or HDB stores the data and are only interested in querying by time range and instrument(s), a Gateway or Load Balancer can significantly increase the system\'s efficiency. A well-designed Gateway can handle query routing, load balancing, authentication, and permission handling, as well as aggregate data before returning it to the user. Additionally, introducing a Gateway API that standardizes data access, manages bad queries, and returns a consistent table schema enhances the application\'s flexibility, scalability, security, and resilience.\\n\\nThe following whitepapers by KX provide more details about Gateways and Load Balancers:\\n- [Common design principles for kdb+ gateways](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/gateway-design/)\\n- [Query Routing: A kdb+ framework for a scalable, load balanced system](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/query-routing/)\\n\\n### Disaster Recovery\\n\\nIn an ideal world, your system is resilient, and a robust business continuity plan prevents major outages. However, we don\'t live in an ideal world. If your system goes down and you need to recover data ingested since the start of the day, the Tickerplant Log file is crucial for Disaster Recovery. The Tickerplant logs every incoming message, allowing you to replay the file and recreate the system\'s state before the outage. For less severe cases, such as the failure and recovery of a single Real-Time Subscriber (RTS), you can recover from the Real-Time Database (RDB). This approach works only if the crashed process was an RTS, not the Tickerplant (TP) itself. Additionally, if multiple processes fail simultaneously, recovering from the RDB may put excessive pressure on it, affecting other processes or users relying on real-time data. As systems grow larger, they become more complex, requiring planning and design of your disaster recovery strategy on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nYou can read about Disaster Recovery here\\n- [Disaster-recovery planning for kdb+ tick systems](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/disaster-recovery/)\\n- [Data recovery for kdb+tick](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/data-recovery/)\\n\\n### Chained Tickerplants: Remedy against Slow Subscribers\\n\\nA slow subscriber is a KDB/Q process consuming real-time data from the Tickerplant at a slower pace than the Tickerplant publishes. This can happen for various reasons, such as the Real-Time Subscriber running time-intensive analytics or encountering unexpected slowdowns. This mismatch in pace can lead to the Tickerplant\'s output queue building up, causing a spike in memory usage, and potentially resulting in the Tickerplant crashing or the server running out of memory. To prevent such scenarios, you can enhance your KDB/Q Tick architecture by introducing a Chained Tickerplant (CTP). A Chained Tickerplant is essentially another Tickerplant positioned after the main Tickerplant, which publishes data in batches based on either the number of messages or a specific time interval. This batching reduces the publishing frequency, allowing slow subscribers to consume messages at a manageable pace. Additionally, if the Chained Tickerplant crashes due to increased load from a slow subscriber, the main Tickerplant remains unaffected and continues to function normally.\\n\\nYou can find some additional information about Chained Tickerplants [here](https://code.kx.com/q/kb/kdb-tick/)\\n\\n### Intraday Writedown\\n\\nIntroducing an Intraday Writedown Database (WDB) adds another tier to your database architecture. In the typical plain vanilla tick setup, you have a Real-Time Database (RDB) for intraday data and a Historical Database (HDB) for historical data. However, as data volume grows, it may exceed your server\'s available memory. To manage this, you can implement an Intraday Writedown Database (WDB), which saves data to disk throughout the day while the RDB holds only the most recent data. This saving process can be triggered by a timer or after a certain number of records. The WDB setup involves two processes: one for saving intraday data to disk and another for querying this saved data from a temporary location. It\'s crucial to note that the WDB is distinct from the HDB; at the end of the day, the intraday data is merged into the HDB and moved from the temporary location. Additionally, you\'ll need to adjust the Gateway logic to ensure the data is accessible to end users. For more details on intraday write downs, refer to this whitepaper:\\n\\n- [Intraday writedown solutions](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/intraday-writedown/)\\n\\n### Database Best Practices\\n\\nNext, we discussed best practices for setting up your database, including various methods for saving data to disk and the application of attributes in your system. In KDB/Q, there are four different attributes: sorted, unique, grouped, and parted, each with distinct behaviors and advantages. For a detailed explanation of these attributes, you can read my blog post [here](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/concepts/attributes).\\nWhen it comes to persisting data to disk, the options include:\\n\\n- Flat file\\n- Splayed table\\n- Partitioned database\\n- Segmented database\\n\\nThe most common setup I\'ve encountered in my career is a partitioned database. For a comprehensive understanding of these different setups, refer to [Chapter 14 of Q for Mortals](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/14_Introduction_to_Kdb%2B/)\\n\\n### Q&A\\n\\nAt the end of the livestream, we also gave attendees the opportunity to ask questions. Here are some of the key takeaways:\\n1. **Do you apply attributes on the Intraday Database?**\\n\\n\\tYes, the attributes you apply to the Historical Database (HDB) should also be applied to the Intraday Database.\\n\\n2. **Is the RDB responsible for both EOI & EOD write-down/merging or is some service specific for this not shown?**\\n\\n\\tIn the plain vanilla setup, the RDB handles both saving data to disk at the end of the day and storing intraday data in memory. However, as data volume grows, the save-down process can take a significant amount of time, during which the RDB would not be available for user queries. To avoid this issue, you could introduce an independent process responsible for saving data to disk. This process would first read data from the Tickerplant Log file into memory and then save it to disk. The drawback is that you need to replay the data from the Tickerplant log first, which takes time and increases the memory load on your server. Generally, you should evaluate the design of your system on a case-by-case basis to determine the most suitable approach.\\n\\nOnce again, I would like to thank everyone who attended the livestream. Your enthusiastic participation motivates us to host more livestreams in the future. Stay tuned and happy coding!"},{"id":"The Magnificent Seven - Mastering KDB/Q Concepts for Data Excellence","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/The Magnificent Seven - Mastering KDB/Q Concepts for Data Excellence","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-10-concepts/index.mdx","title":"The Magnificent Seven - Mastering KDB/Q Concepts for Data Excellence","description":"When developers first encounter KDB/Q, they are often intimidated by its \\"strange\\" syntax, which differs significantly from most other programming languages they\'ve seen.

Understanding these concepts will provide insight into why KDB/Q is so powerful and favoured among quants and data enthusiasts.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n:::note\\nPlease note, this blog post is primarily aimed at readers who are new to the KDB/Q programming language or just starting their learning journey. If you already have some experience with KDB/Q or are a seasoned developer, you might already be familiar with some or all of these concepts.\\n:::\\n\\n![The Magnificient Seven](./seven.png)\\n\\n## Left of Right and no Operator Precedence\\n\\n### Concept\\nOne of the most common mistakes made by qbies (newcomers to KDB/Q) is forgetting that KDB/Q is left-of-right, meaning it\'s read from right to left and has no operator precedence.\\n### Details\\nUnlike traditional programming languages like Java, C++, or Python, KDB/Q reads expressions from right to left. This makes expression evaluation simple and uniform, without unnecessary parentheses cluttering the code. Left-to-right evaluation eliminates any ambiguity in expressions, at least from the compiler\'s perspective if not yours. While parentheses can still be used to group terms and override the default evaluation order, you will find them much less necessary once you break old habits.\\n### Example\\nWhen evaluating the expression `3*2+3` in KDB/Q, the result is `15`, rather than `9` as you might expect from traditional programming languages. This happens because KDB/Q adds `3` to `2` first, resulting in `5`, which is then multiplied by `3` to get the final result of `15`. To evaluate the multiplication first, you need to use parentheses around the expression. \\n```\\nq)3*2+3\\n15\\nq)(3*2)+3\\n9\\n```\\n\\n## KDB/Q is Atomic\\n\\n### Concept\\nAnother important concept of KDB/Q is that most built-in operators are atomic. This means that functions iterate recursively through data structures such as lists or dictionaries until they reach individual atoms and then apply the function to it.\\n### Details\\nAtomic functions apply recursively to every element of a list or dictionary. For unary atomic functions (those that take one parameter), the function applies to both atoms and lists, and for lists, it applies independently to each atom within the list. Binary atomic functions (those that take two parameters) can be atomic in both operands, resulting in four different applications:\\n\\n- Both operands are atoms.\\n- The first operand is a list, and the second is an atom.\\n- The first operand is an atom, and the second is a list.\\n- Both operands are lists.\\n### Example\\n```\\n// unary atomic function\\nq)neg 10\\n-10\\nq)neg 10 20 30\\n-10 -20 -30\\nq)neg (10 20 30; 40 50)\\n-10 -20 -30\\n-40 -50\\nq)neg `a`b`c!10 20 30\\na| -10\\nb| -20\\nc| -30\\nq)neg `a`b`c!(10 20; 30 40 50; 60)\\na| -10 -20\\nb| -30 -40 -50\\nc| -60\\n// binary atmoic function\\nq)1+10\\n11\\nq)1+10 20 30\\n11 21 31\\nq)1 2 3+10\\n11 12 13\\nq)1 2 3+10 20 30\\n11 22 33\\n```\\n\\nThis atomic behavior makes KDB/Q a very powerful and efficient programming language. Imagine you have a nested list of numbers, some of which are null. Your task is to replace all null values with `0`. In a traditional programming language like Java, you would need to loop through every element of the list and then through each sublist, as a nested list can contain multiple lists. In KDB/Q, however, this task is as simple as using the [`greator OR |`](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/greater/) operator\\n\\n```\\nq)((0N 1 2 0N);((1 3;0N 1 2);(1 2 3;0N 0N 1 2));4 5 0N)\\n0N 1 2 0N\\n((1 3;0N 1 2);(1 2 3;0N 0N 1 2))\\n4 5 0N\\nq)0|((0N 1 2 0N);((1 3;0N 1 2);(1 2 3;0N 0N 1 2));4 5 0N)\\n0 1 2 0\\n((1 3;0 1 2);(1 2 3;0 0 1 2))\\n4 5 0\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Vector Operations and Column Oriented\\n\\n### Concept\\nThe previous concept of KDB/Q being atomic makes it inherently a vector-oriented language, meaning it operates on entire arrays (vectors) of data in a single operation.\\n### Details\\nInstead of processing individual elements in loops, KDB/Q applies functions and operations to whole vectors at once. This not only simplifies code but also significantly boosts performance by leveraging CPU vectorization capabilities. \\n### Example\\nTo add two vectors `a` and `b`, you simply write `c:a+b`. This operation is applied element-wise across the entire vectors.\\n```\\nq)a:1 2 3\\nq)b:4 5 6\\nq)show c:a+b\\n5 7 9\\n```\\nThis behaviour also extends to tables. KDB/Q is column-oriented and stores tables as flipped column dictionaries, with each column stored in contiguous memory as a vector. This setup allows for vectorized mathematical operations, making table manipulation incredibly fast.\\n\\n```\\nq)show t:([] a:1 2 3;b:4 5 6)\\na b\\n---\\n1 4\\n2 5\\n3 6\\nq)update c:a+b,d:a*b,e:neg a,f:10+b from t\\na b c d  e  f\\n--------------\\n1 4 5 4  -1 14\\n2 5 7 10 -2 15\\n3 6 9 18 -3 16\\n```\\n\\n## Interpreted and dynamic\\n\\n### Concept\\nKDB/Q code is interpreted at runtime, and both variables and functions are dynamic. This means they can hold data of any type, and the type can change during execution.\\n### Details\\nKDB/Q is both interpreted and dynamic, meaning that code doesn\'t need to be compiled and all functions are compiled into bytecode at runtime. Additionally, as a dynamic language, function definitions and variable types can be changed at runtime, with no type checking performed before execution. While these features make KDB/Q highly flexible, they also require careful design, thorough testing, and robust error handling to prevent production outages.\\n### Example\\nBelow, we illustrate the dynamic behavior of KDB/Q by first assigning a string to a variable `a`, then changing it to a numerical value, and finally to a function that we can execute.\\n```\\nq)show a:\\"Hello\\"\\n\\"Hello\\"\\nq)show a:2\\n2\\nq)show a:{x+y}\\n{x+y}\\nq)a[2;3]\\n5\\n```\\n## Functional\\n\\n### Concept\\nKDB/Q heavily incorporates functional programming paradigms, emphasizing the use of functions as first-class citizens.\\n### Details\\nFunctions can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and composed to build more complex functionality. KDB/Q\'s syntax and functions make it easy to perform operations like map, reduce, and filter directly on data sets. However, it\'s worth mentioning that KDB/Q is not purely functional as functions can have side effects.\\n### Example\\nApplying a function to each element of a list can be done with `f each list`, where `f` is a user-defined function.\\n```\\nq)f:count\\nq)f each (\\"Hello\\";1 2 3;(2 3;4 5))\\n5 3 2\\n```\\n\\n## Dictionaries, Tables and Keyed Tables\\n\\n### Concept\\nKDB/Q provides powerful data structures for efficient data storage and manipulation natively and supports both row-oriented and column-oriented data access. These data structures include dictionaries, tables and keyed tables.\\n### Details\\nDictionaries, Tables and Keyed Tables are data structures designed for high performance, efficient data storage and access and ideal for analytical tasks. All three data structures are supported by KDB/Q out of the box and are optimised to achieve optimal performance. In KDB/Q, Tables are similar to SQL tables with the difference that KDB/Q is column oriented, meaning each column is stored as a vector in contiguous memory, allowing for vectorised operations and making mathematical computations lightning fast. \\n### Example\\nDemonstrating the power and performance of tables in analytics\\n```\\n// First we create a dummy table with random data\\nq)show t:([] sym:10?`AAPL`C`C`MSFT`AAPL; price:10?100.0; qty:10?1000)\\nsym  price    qty\\n-----------------\\nC    49.31835 908\\nC    57.85203 360\\nAAPL 8.388858 522\\nC    19.59907 257\\nC    37.5638  858\\nC    61.37452 585\\nC    52.94808 90\\nAAPL 69.16099 683\\nAAPL 22.96615 90\\nC    69.19531 869\\n// Calculating the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) per symbol for the data\\nq)select wvap:price wavg qty by sym from t\\nsym | wvap\\n----| --------\\nAAPL| 534.0731\\nC   | 585.5224\\n// Updating the table with the VWAP\\nq)update wvap:price wavg qty by sym from t\\nsym  price    qty wvap\\n--------------------------\\nC    49.31835 908 585.5224\\nC    57.85203 360 585.5224\\nAAPL 8.388858 522 534.0731\\nC    19.59907 257 585.5224\\nC    37.5638  858 585.5224\\nC    61.37452 585 585.5224\\nC    52.94808 90  585.5224\\nAAPL 69.16099 683 534.0731\\nAAPL 22.96615 90  534.0731\\nC    69.19531 869 585.5224\\n// Retrieving the well-known metrics: open, high, low, and close for each symbol\\nq)exec `o`h`l`c!(first;max;min;last)@\\\\:price by sym from t\\n    | o        h        l        c\\n----| -----------------------------------\\nAAPL| 8.388858 69.16099 8.388858 22.96615\\nC   | 49.31835 69.19531 19.59907 69.19531\\n```\\n## Synchronous and Asynchronous IPC for Real-Time Data\\n\\n### Concept\\nNo other programming language makes interprocess communication (IPC) as easy and straightforward as KDB/Q. Designed for real-time data processing and streaming, KDB/Q supports both synchronous and asynchronous messaging right out of the box.\\n### Details\\nDesigning event driven applications is critical for financial applications where real-time data feeds and low-latency processing are essential. KDB/Q processes and updates data in real-time, handling high-throughput data streams efficiently. Opening connections between two KDB/Q processes, whether on the same server or different servers, requires minimal effort and can be accomplished with a single command. Data is serialized before being sent and deserialized upon receipt, minimizing the amount of data transferred over the network. Asynchronous communication and advanced IPC patterns can be leveraged to design efficient and scalable applications.\\n### Example\\n```\\n// Server: start a q process and assign port 5001 to it\\nq)\\\\p 5001\\nq)\\n// Client: Open a connection to the server using hopen and send a synchronous query to it\\nq)h:hopen `::5001\\nq)h\\"2+2\\"\\n4\\n```\\n\\n## Bonus: Single Threaded\\n\\n### Concept\\nKDB/Q operates in a single-threaded mode by default, ensuring data consistency and avoiding race conditions, as all operations are executed in the order they are received.\\n### Details\\nEven though KDB/Q is single-threaded, simplifying program design and avoiding the complexities of multi-threaded applications, you can still leverage parallel processing by starting your KDB/Q process with secondary threads using `-s n`, where `n` is the number of secondary threads. Moreover, since KDB/Q version 4.0, all primitive operators are implicitly multi-threaded. Starting your KDB/Q process with a negative secondary threads flag `-s -n` will utilize parallel processes instead of secondary threads for parallel processing.\\n### Example\\n```\\nq)f:{sum exp x?1.0}\\nq)\\\\ts f each 2#1000000\\n25 16777728\\nq)\\\\ts f peach 2#1000000 ~\\n0 1120\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nUnderstanding these key concepts is crucial for mastering KDB/Q and elevating your development skills. Each concept, from the left-of-right evaluation and atomic functions to dynamic typing and interprocess communication, contributes to the power and efficiency of KDB/Q, making it a preferred choice for real-time data processing and high-performance analytics. By familiarizing yourself with these principles, you\'ll be better equipped to leverage the full potential of KDB/Q, enabling you to write more efficient, robust, and maintainable code. \\n\\nIf you like to deepen your knowledge further, check out the following references and links\\n\\n- [How To Read, Understand and Learn KDB/Q Code](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/How%20to%20Read,%20Understand%20and%20Learn%20KDB/Q%20code)\\n- [Dictionaries and Tables](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/concepts/dictionariesTables)\\n- [The Plain Vanilla Tick Setup](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/architecture/plain)\\n- [KDB Tick Explained - A Walkthrough](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/tutorials/tick)\\n- [Unleashing the Power of Time-Series Analysis and Big Data: Why KDB/Q Reigns Supreme](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/language/why_KDB)"},{"id":"DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-01-fancyQuant/index.mdx","title":"DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","description":"In this blog post, I have a special treat for you.

Additionally, their blog covers a wide range of subjects including [architecture design and reviews](https://dataintellect.com/blog/ark-0-introducing-ark/), [memory properties of KDB/Q](https://dataintellect.com/blog/kdb-is-memory-hungry-right/), [version updates](https://dataintellect.com/blog/unlimited-connections-a-kdb-4-1-story/) and their implications, [framewokrs](https://dataintellect.com/blog/ark-1-kdb-framework/) as well as technologies that interface with KDB/Q. I vividly recall Jonny\'s KDB/Q Architecture presentation at a London KDB Meetup nearly a decade ago\u2014it was a crucial moment where I learned invaluable insights into KDB/Q architecture design, best practices, and pitfalls to avoid. If you\'re seeking to enhance your KDB/Q expertise, I highly recommend diving into their blog.\\n\\n### [Timestored Blog by Ryan Hamilton](https://www.timestored.com/b/)\\n\\nAn often overlooked but invaluable source of KDB/Q wisdom is [Ryan Hamilton\'s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justryanhamilton/) blog on [Timestored](https://www.timestored.com). Ryan, a seasoned KDB/Q developer with an esteemed reputation, has build numerous large-scale enterprise systems for various investment banks. Although Ryan\'s primary focus is now on [Pulse](https://www.timestored.com/pulse/) (I have blogged about Pulse [here](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/productivity/pulse)), a developer platform for internal data UIs, his blog remains a treasure trove of insights derived from decades of hands-on experience. It was through his blog that I gained a deep understanding of KDB/Q\'s [memory management](https://www.timestored.com/kdb-guides/memory-management), knowledge I haven\'t found anywhere else (for a comprehensive blog about memory management, read my post [here](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/concepts/memoryManagement). In addition to the wealth of KDB/Q insights available on Ryan\'s blog, you also have the opportunity to download [qstudio](https://www.timestored.com/qstudio/) \u2014 an IDE originally tailored for KDB/Q but now accommodating various other databases as well.   \\n\\n### [Ferenc Bodon\'s Blog](https://bodonferenc.github.io)\\n\\n[Ferenc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferencbodon/) currently as the Head of Benchmarking and Engineering at KX Hungary, has a rich background as an experienced data engineer, software developer, and multilingual programmer. Before joining KX, Ferenc worked for more than a decade at Morgan Stanley, building out and extending their KDB/Q data warehouse. With expertise spanning software architecture and an academic foundation in data mining and statistics, Ferenc occasionally shares his wisdom on KDB/Q or conducts insightful comparisons between KDB/Q and other mainstream programming languages via his [blog](https://bodonferenc.github.io). Whenever he shares his insights, it\'s certainly worthwhile to take note.\\n\\n### [Q201 by Stephen Taylor](https://q201.org)\\n\\nFinally, I\'m thrilled to introduce [Stephen Taylor\'s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/) initiative, [Q201](https://q201.org) - a novel learning platform tailored for KDB/Q programmers, with a keen focus on understanding the syntax and semantics of this unique language, along with vector-programming techniques. Stephen has decades of software development experience, with a particularly strong background in APL\u2014an influence that resonates strongly in Arthur\'s creation of KDB/Q. Notably, Stephen also served as the librarian for the official KDB/Q documentation at KX. Personally, I consider Stephen one of the rare KDB/Q developers who not only comprehends the language\'s complexity but also possesses the ability and patience to educate them to us mere mortals. Initially drafted as a textbook titled \\"Post Atomic: Vector programming in q,\\" Stephen opted to release the content freely as a website, aspiring to establish a communal learning hub for KDB/Q enthusiasts. The website is complemented by q201.chat on StackExchange and a Study Buddy pinboard for connecting with fellow learners. This project is particularly close to my heart, as Stephen offered me the opportunity to collaborate with him, enabling me to deepen my involvement in the community to which he\'s been such a pivotal contributor and advocate. For those seeking a deeper grasp of KDB/Q, I highly recommend exploring Q201.\\n\\n\\n**That\'s all folks.

Hence, it\'s crucial to adopt a systematic approach to code organization. Doing so not only ensures extensibility and scalability but also simplifies development in the long run. Modularizing your code, as well as other various strategies exist for organizing code. In traditional object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#, organization typically revolves around classes, packages, or, on a broader scale, projects. However, there\'s no reason why a similar concept can\'t be applied in KDB/Q. In this blog post, I\'ll introduce a simple yet effective method of organizing your code. Additionally, I\'ll share some valuable tips and tricks gleaned from years of experience.\\n\\n## KDB/Q Code organisation: an example\\n\\nOne easy way to organise your code involves splitting the code into a **library file** containing all Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and an **execute file** containing initialization logic along with global variable definitions, loaded by a KDB/Q process upon start-up. You can then package your code into various modules or packages based on dataset, asset class, or any other classification of your preference, applying the library and execute file pattern consistently across them. \\n\\n### Power Packed Libraries: Bundled Functionality\\n\\nTo enhance the extensibility and scalability of your application, it\'s recommended to make your code as modular as possible. This can be accomplished by exposing the business logic of your code through an API and consolidating functions related to specific functionalities or features into individual packages. Let\'s consider the scenario where we aim to construct a library containing fundamental mathematical functions. The following code snippet demonstrates the contents of our library file:\\n\\n:::note\\nBelow code is a very basic, simplified example for illustrative purposes\\n:::\\n\\n```\\n// math.library.q\\n// This is a library to compute basic mathematical operations\\n\\n// add: \\tFunction to perform addition\\n// @param: \\tx - first parameter\\n// @param: \\ty - second parameter\\n// @return: \\tsum of x and y\\nadd:{[x;y]\\n        :x+y;\\n        };\\n\\n// sub: \\tFunction to perform subtraction\\n// @param:\\tx - first parameter\\n// @param:\\ty - second parameter\\n// @return:\\tsubtracts y from x\\nsub:{[x;y]\\n        :x-y;\\n        };\\n\\n// mult:\\tFunction to perform multiplication\\n// @param:\\tx - first parameter\\n// @param:\\ty - second parameter\\n// @result:\\tproduct of x and y\\nmult:{[x;y]\\n        :x*y;\\n        };\\n```\\n\\nNow, we\'ve developed our very own, simple math library featuring essential functions that can be reused as required. We can effortlessly load this library into any process to leverage its functionality without having to duplicate any code. In the following section, we\'ll demonstrate how to utilize this library.\\n\\n### Seamless Integration: The Execute File Solution\\n\\nWhile you can load your library into nearly any KDB/Q process allows for reusing the exposed APIs, another approach involves creating a file to be passed to a KDB/Q process during startup. Within this file, you can initialize global variables utilized within the process and establish an initialization function to be called upon the process\'s start. But examples speak louder than words, so let\'s check one out.\\n\\n```\\n// math.exe.q\\n// This is our execution file, the file we load when we start our KDB/Q process\\n// Loading the math library we created, exposing all the functions in it\\nsystem \\"l math.library.q\\";\\n\\n// Setting global variables\\nnum1:4;\\nnum3:8;\\n\\n// init:\\tInitialisation function\\ninit:{[]\\n\\t// Within our initialisation function we define another number\\n\\tnum2:5;\\n\\t// We can now use the APIs defined in our libray\\n\\t-1 \\"Adding number \\",string[num1], \\" to number \\", string[num2], \\" --\x3e result: \\",string add[num1;num2];\\n        -1 \\"Subtracting number \\",string[a], \\" from number \\", string[b], \\" --\x3e result: \\",string add[b:9;a:3];\\n        -1 \\"Multiplying number \\",string[num2], \\" with number \\", string[num3], \\" --\x3e result: \\",string add[num2;num3];\\n\\t};\\n\\n// At then end of our execute file we call the init function\\ninit[];\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can initiate a KDB/Q process and load our execute file upon startup. This action handles the loading of our library, initializes any global variables, and then executes the init function to complete the remaining initialization tasks.\\n\\n```\\nAlexander@Alexanders-MacBook-Pro:~/repos/testCode|\\n\u21d2  qq math.exe.q\\nKDB+ 4.0 2023.01.20 Copyright (C) 1993-2023 Kx Systems\\nm64/ 4(24)core 8192MB Alexander alexanders-macbook-pro.local 127.0.0.1 EXPIRE 2025.02.21 XXXX@gmail.com KDB PLUS TRIAL #5018719\\n\\nAdding number 4 to number 5 --\x3e result: 9\\nSubtracting number 3 from number 9 --\x3e result: 12\\nMultiplying number 5 with number 8 --\x3e result: 13\\nq)\\n```\\nAbove pattern is a powerful yet simple  technique for structuring your code and enhancing its modularity. By grouping similar functionalities into a library, you can conveniently reuse them as required, thereby eliminating redundant code duplication. Additionally, the execution file provides an easy method to configure your KDB/Q process and import all necessary libraries.\\n\\n## Leveraging Namespaces\\n\\nIn the upcoming section, I\'ll share two additional tips and tricks that I\'ve found to be especially useful when organizing your code. These strategies not only contribute to cleaner code but also enhance its comprehensibility and ease of navigation.\\n\\n### Same Yet Different\\n\\nAt times, we find ourselves repeatedly implementing similar or identical functionalities, with only minor variations, such as asset class, instrument, or data source. This practice not only complicates the code and reduces readability but it can also be very confusing for users. They may wonder which function to use, what parameters to pass, and how the result appears. In the following section, I\'ll demonstrate how namespaces can simplify everyone\'s workflow.\\n\\nLet\'s have a look at some code. First, we create a helper function, to verify whether a certain function exists or not. We can do so by using the [`key`](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/key/) operator. While the `key` operator is commonly used for retrieving the keys of a dictionary or table, it can also be used to verify whether a folder or file exists, or in our case, if a name is defined or not.\\n\\n```\\nq)exists:{not ()~key x}\\nq)exists `a\\n0b\\nq)a:1\\nq)exists `a\\n1b\\n```\\nNext, we\'ll develop a set of functions that exhibit similar behavior but with slight variations. Specifically, in our scenario, he behaviour of the function differ based on the data source we want to retrieve. Additionally, we include a default function for cases where the user specifies a data source for which we haven\'t implemented a function yet. In such instances, we\'ll return the result using a default data source.\\n\\n```\\nq).equities.bloomberg.getData:{: ([] sym:`AAPL`MSFT`GOOG; source:3#`BBG;price:3?10)}\\nq).equities.refinitive.getData:{: ([] sym:`AAPL`MSFT`GOOG; source:3#`REF;price:3?10)}\\nq).equities.default.getData:{: ([] sym:`AAPL`MSFT`GOOG; source:3#`INHOUSE;price:3?10)}\\n```\\n\\nFinally, all we have to do, is to create a function that we are going to expose to our users. The user will specify the data source they desire, and the function will handle the appropriate call to the corresponding function. Should the specified data source be unavailable, we\'ll return data obtained from a default source.\\n\\n```\\n.equities.getData:{[datasource] \\n\\t// Create the namespace for the datasource and verify if it exists\\n\\t// If it exists, invoke the function and return result\\n\\t// If it doesn\'t, invoke default function and return result\\n\\tif[exists f:` sv (`.equities;datasource;`getData);:f[]]; :.equities.default.getData[] \\n\\t};\\n```\\n\\nBelow code should illustrate this behaviour\\n\\n```\\n// Verify if function exists. Note: typo\\nq)exists `.equities.bloomber.getData\\n0b\\n// Existing function\\nq)exists `.equities.bloomberg.getData\\n1b\\n// Creating the namespace\\nq)` sv `.equities`bloomberg`getData\\n`.equities.bloomberg.getData\\n// Combining above\\nq)exists ` sv `.equities`bloomberg`getData\\n1b\\n// individual functions\\nq).equities.refinitive.getData[]\\nsym  source price\\n-----------------\\nAAPL REF    8\\nMSFT REF    1\\nGOOG REF    9\\nq).equities.bloomberg.getData[]\\nsym  source price\\n-----------------\\nAAPL BBG    5\\nMSFT BBG    4\\nGOOG BBG    6\\n// the .equities namespace\\nq).equities\\n          | ::\\nbloomberg | ``getData!(::;{: ([] sym:`AAPL`MSFT`GOOG; source:3#`BBG;price:3?1..\\nrefinitive| ``getData!(::;{: ([] sym:`AAPL`MSFT`GOOG; source:3#`REF;price:3?1..\\ndefault   | ``getData!(::;{: ([] sym:`AAPL`MSFT`GOOG; source:3#`INHOUSE;price..\\ngetData   | {[datasource] if[exists f:` sv (`.equities;datasource;`getData);:..\\n// Function exposed to and used by clients\\nq).equities.getData[`bloomberg]\\nsym  source price\\n-----------------\\nAAPL BBG    5\\nMSFT BBG    4\\nGOOG BBG    9\\nq).equities.getData[`refinitive]\\nsym  source price\\n-----------------\\nAAPL REF    2\\nMSFT REF    7\\nGOOG REF    0\\n// Function call with data source that doesn\'t exists\\n// Defaults to INHOUSE data\\nq).equities.getData[`ICE]\\nsym  source  price\\n------------------\\nAAPL INHOUSE 1\\nMSFT INHOUSE 9\\nGOOG INHOUSE 2\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, we\'ve developed a feature that exposes just one simple API to our clients, ensuring ease and simplicity in their usage. Furthermore, we\'re now capable of effortlessly expanding our function\'s behavior and incorporating more functionalities for new data sources, requiring minimal code refactoring.\\n\\n### Namespaces Revealed: Your Handy Dictionary\\n\\nIn KDB/Q, namespaces essentially function as dictionaries. This feature allows us to create diverse behaviors without resorting to complex and confusing `if-else` statements. You can read more about namespaces [here](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/12_Workspace_Organization/#121-namespaces). Let\'s have a look at a simple example:\\n\\nFirst we create the `.upd` namespace and define functions for (a table) trade and order\\n```\\nq).upd.trade:{[x] `trade set x}\\nq).upd.order:{[x] `order set x}\\n// We can inspect the .upd namespace\\nq).upd\\n     | ::\\ntrade| {[x] `trade set x}\\norder| {[x] `order set x}\\n```\\n\\nSince a namespace operates like a dictionary, we can leverage indexing to access the appropriate function for various tables. By providing the table name as the first parameter, we effectively index into our namespace, triggering the function and utilizing the second parameter as its input.\\n\\n```\\nq).upd[`trade;([] time:enlist .z.p; sym:`AAP; side:`buy; price:10; qty: 100)]\\n`trade\\nq)trade\\ntime                          sym side price qty\\n------------------------------------------------\\n2024.05.15D07:40:13.902355000 AAP buy  10    100\\nq).upd[`order;([] time:enlist .z.p; sym:`AAP; side:`buy; qty: 100)]\\n`order\\nq)order\\ntime                          sym side qty\\n------------------------------------------\\n2024.05.15D07:40:31.927281000 AAP buy  100\\n```\\n\\n## Gotchas\\n\\nWhile an in-depth discussion of API design best practices exceeds the scope of this blog post, I\'d like to offer two crucial suggestions for creating your APIs. Firstly, simplicity is key. An API should focus on accomplishing one single task, and one single task only. You should avoid the temptation to create a \\"solve every problem in the world API\\". Secondly, if your API extends beyond 10 lines of code (and indeed, in KDB/Q, 10 lines is quite substantial), consider refactoring and breaking it into smaller, more manageable functions. Additionally, it\'s advisable to avoid reliance on global variables within your functions. From my experience, this often leads to bugs or, worse, production outages. Instead, if a function requires a variable, pass it as a parameter. Depending on a globally defined variable not only introduces the risk of it being undefined but also renders your API less versatile, as it cannot be reused without redefining the global variable in another process.\\n\\n**That\'s all folks.

However, if this happens to be your first visit, allow me to offer a brief introduction. DefconQ is a technology blog dedicated to all things KDB/Q. Initially conceived to aid individuals in grasping the fundamentals of KDB/Q, my aim is to simplify the complexities of the Q programming language, along with essential KDB/Q language and architecture concepts. Encountering challenges during my own journey with KDB/Q and grappling with its steep learning curve, I founded DefconQ\u2014a KDB/Q tech blog that I wished had existed when I first embarked on this endeavor.\\n\\n## The Hosts - [Habla Computing](https://hablapps.com)\\n\\nFinally, I\'m excited to introduce the host of this fantastic event: [Habla Computing](https://hablapps.com), your trusted companion in software architecture. Led by Juan, the founding partner, and Jesus, the VP of Research, Habla Computing drives digital transformation through functional programming and language-driven architectures. Among their array (pun intended) of services, Habla Computing offers:\\n\\n- Architecture: You can count on their knowledge and experience in designing well-founded libraries, frameworks and applications, to grow your codebase from a solid start or re-engineer major components from solid principles\\n- Consulting: Habla Computing helps companies to ensure that technology issues are kept under control during the whole project life-cycle. \\n- Training: Condensed training in Scala and KDB/Q as well as tailor-maded courses for you or your development team.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn summary, the event was a resounding success. Although the turnout in Madrid could have been higher, we were delighted to be joined by over a hundred attendees online from various corners of the globe. The lower attendance in Madrid can be attributed to competing events and the allure of enjoying the event from the comfort of one\'s home. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed meeting colleagues and peers and had a great time presenting. It\'s inspiring to witness the expansion of the KDB/Q community beyond traditional financial hubs like London or New York. Additionally, I\'m pleased to see the growing presence of female developers, highlighted by the fact that I was the only male speaker at the event. I am eagerly looking forward to many more events like this and I am committed to attending, whether as a speaker or as an attendee. . \\n\\n## Pictures\\n![Alex](./alex.webp)\\n(Alexander presenting: How to get started with KDB/Q)\\n\\n![Group](./group.webp)\\n(The speakers and the hosts.

A major update had been released some time ago, and due to my limited enthusiasm for front-end development, I had been postponing this task as long as possible. However, I finally decided to tackle it this weekend. After reviewing the recommended upgrade instructions provided in the official documentation, I prepared all necessary steps and then started the upgrade.

After completing the upgrade, I conducted one final verification to confirm that everything was running as expected in my browser. Satisfied with the results, I committed my changes and pushed them to the repository of my blog.\\n\\nNow, all that remained was deploying the new version to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). I executed the command `USE_SSH=true yarn deploy` as I typically do, pressed enter, and awaited the customary `[INFO]` messages. However, instead of the expected outcome, I was confronted with a bright, red error message.  \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n```\\n[ERROR] Deployment of the build output failed.\\n\\nError: Running \\"git push\\" command failed. \\nDoes the GitHub user account you are using have push access to the repository?\\n```\\n\\nUgh, of course. Something went wrong. However, my blog ran smoothly locally. I meticulously reviewed all my steps again, compared the `docusaurus.config.js` file with the new `docusaurus.config.ts` script I had to generate as part of the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript. Everything appeared to be in order. So why wasn\'t it functioning properly? The error message resembled an `SSH` issue, prompting me to double-check all my GIT configurations, and even recreate `SSH` keys, but to nothing.\\n\\nThen, I proceeded with the typical routine every developer follows when encountering an issue: I searched for help on the internet, StackOverflow, Google search, blogs, forums, but unfortunately, none of the resources I explored offered a solution to my dilemma. Eventually, I stumbled upon a post suggesting that I delete the gh-pages branch of my repository \u2014 the branch responsible for hosting my blog online - and recreating it might resolve the issue. This sounded like a plausible remedy, so I proceeded accordingly. Regrettably, the solution did not rectify my problem; in fact, it exacerbated it. Deleting the branch responsible for hosting my blog rendered it inaccessible. While I may not boast millions of readers, the embarrassment of visitors encountering an offline blog was real.\\n\\nI began to feel a tinge of concern and proceeded to review everything one more time, attempting a few additional troubleshooting steps, but nothing worked. At this point, my last resort was seeking assistance from a more seasoned developer. Fortunately, one of my close friends from university happened to be one of those exceptional talents - often referred to as **10X developers** in the tech industry. Regardless of the topic at hand, he possessed the ability to grasp concepts within minutes. Most technical challenges that had stumped me in the past seemed trivial to him. While the only programming language he wasn\'t well-versed in happened to be KDB/Q, I was fortunate that this particular issue did not pertain to that domain. Armed with a few screenshots and a concise explanation detailing my efforts and attempted solutions, I composed a message and eagerly awaited his response.\\n\\nKnowing that he had recently welcomed his second child and that my trivial web development issues were understandably not a priority compared to his new responsibilities, I decided to take a leisurely stroll with my girlfriend and some friends. Several hours later, I received a response from him\u2014a few links to potential solutions, all of which I had already explored. Following that, he inquired about my GIT repository URL, username, and a few other details. After confirming these details, I received a smiley face emoji in response. It was then pointed out to me that I had a typo in my GIT username\u2014I had mistakenly written De**c**fonQ rather than De**f**conQ. With this embarrassing oversight corrected, I was finally able to deploy my blog once again, and it was back up and running as usual.\\n\\nThis experience, reminded me once again, about the significance of code review and why it should be an integral part of every software development life cycle. Which brings me to the main topic of this blog post: **code review**.\\n\\n## What is code review and why you should practice it\\n\\nIn the software development industry, code review is a fundamental practice that involves systematically examining code changes made by developers. It serves as a crucial quality assurance measure, ensuring that code meets standards, is free of bugs, and aligns with project requirements. Code review is important for several reasons:\\n\\n- Firstly, it provides an opportunity for developers to have their code reviewed by their peers ensuring certain **quality standards and controls**, receiving valuable feedback on potential improvements or adherence to best practices.\\n- **Sharing and transferring knowledge**: Code reviews are a great opportunity to share or gain expertise. The depth of this knowledge transfer varies widely, however, there will always be some level of information exchange.\\n- **Spreading ownership**: Code reviews  allow developers to review code written by others, facilitating learning and deeper understanding of the system being developed. This will foster mutual code ownership. It\'s common for a developer to become solely responsible for a specific part of the codebase due to their familiarity with it. While this might offer short-term advantages, it often leads to long-term drawbacks. When ownership of the code is shared among team members, it promotes motivation and autonomy within the team.\\n-  Moreover, code review encourages **collaboration** within teams, as developers can provide constructive feedback to one another and engage in discussions about software development practices.\\n- **Unify development styles**: Each developer has their unique approaches and preferences when it comes to implementing software. Code reviews play a crucial role in bridging the gap between individual development styles, thereby promoting a more unified codebase. This unification occurs through both high-level discussions concerning architecture and software design, as well as micro-level continuous integration checks like enforcing coding style consistency.\\n- For junior developers, code review offers a unique chance to benefit from the experience and expertise of more seasoned developers.\\n\\nFor a comprehensive guide on code reviews and best practices, make sure to read the excellent article [\\"A Complete Guide to Code Review\\"](https://www.swarmia.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-code-reviews/) by Kimmo Brunfeldt.\\n\\nUltimately, no code should be deployed to a production environment without undergoing a formal code review and obtaining the approval of at least two other developers, a best practice that development teams should adhere to. **DefconQ** on the other hand, will simply postpone future front end updates or outsource it to an experts. Volunteers are more than welcome.\\n\\n**Resources**:\\n[A complete guide to code reviews](https://www.swarmia.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-code-reviews/) by Kimmo Brunfeldt"},{"id":"Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-30-AOC/index.mdx","title":"Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","description":"It\'s this time of the year again: it\'s getting cold and dark outside, the days are getting shorter, Chris Rea is driving home, Santa is coming to town and all Mariah Carey wants for Christmas is you.

And what could possibly be better for that than tackling the daily coding challenges presented by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)? \\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAdvent of Code is a daily coding challenge presented in the form of an advent calendar, running from December 1st to Christmas Day, December 25th. Initially created in 2015 by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), it has become widely popular among programmers across various programming languages.\\n\\nThe challenges are in form of small programming puzzles designed for diverse skill sets and levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. Participants use these puzzles for interview preparation, company training, university coursework, practice problems, engaging in speed contests, or challenging one another. You also don\'t need a computer science background in order to participate; a basic understanding of programming and some problem-solving skills are sufficient to make progress. Moreover, a high-end computer is not a requirement; each problem is designed to have a solution that runs within 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.\\n\\nEach day at midnight EST, a new problem is revealed, comprising two small problems that increase in difficulty as you advance through December. Solving each part of the problem correctly earns you one star. For those of you who love a competition, there are leaderboards, where earning the first star is worth 100 points, the second is 99, and so forth, down to 1 point for 100th place.\\n\\nWhile KDB/Q may not always be the optimal programming language for solving all puzzles, it serves as an excellent platform to sharpen your KDB/Q skills and cultivate creative problem-solving abilities. It provides an opportunity to tackle challenges that might not be encountered in your daily work routine. If you ever get stuck in one of the problems or don\'t feel experienced enough, don\'t lose hope. There are plenty of developers who share their solutions on LinkedIn or [KX Community](https://community.kx.com) and you can learn a lot by looking at their solutions.\\n\\nGet your keyboards ready, Advent of Code starts tomorrow!

In any of these scenarios, the need for assistance arises, and in this blog post, we\'ll look at the different options for help with your KDB/Q challenges.  \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn the early days of KDB/Q (technically it was K back then but lets keep the history of KDB/Q for another blog post), comprehensive documentation and online resources were scarce. For those utilizing KDB/Q in a professional capacity, one option was to register with your work email address on a listbox/topicbox email distribution list. Here, you could post your questions or inquiries, relying on the hope that experienced and knowledgeable developers within the community would offer responses. Nevertheless, if you weren\'t using KDB/Q in a professional context or attempted to learn it independently, there were limited documentation and resources at your disposal.\\n\\nOver time, the KDB/Q community expanded, leading to more comprehensive documentation and increased resources for seeking assistance. While KDB/Q doesn\'t enjoy the same level of all-pervasive online information as Python, where a simple Google search for \'How to do XYZ in Python\' yields countless results, you can still depend on the two sources mentioned below to access support.\\n\\n## KX Community\\n\\nIn September 2021, KX launched the KX Community, an online forum designed to serve as a centralized hub for all your KDB/Q inquiries. Within this forum, queries and issues are categorized into various discussion topics, including KDB/Q, KX Solutions or Products, KX Academy (which I previously discussed [here](https://defconq.tech/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources#kx-academy)), KX Insight, or their latest offering, KDB.AI.\\n\\nThe forum is open to anyone seeking answers related to KDB/Q, offering a user-friendly interface. It enjoys active participation from KDB/Q developers within the industry, and, notably, it is closely monitored by seasoned developers from KX. These KX experts serve as forum administrators and actively engage by responding to inquiries and questions.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the KX Community serves as an excellent resource for assistance when you encounter challenges. Additionally, it provides a valuable platform for acquiring knowledge about prevalent issues and their corresponding resolutions. Whether you\'re striving to comprehend the intricacies of KDB/Q, grappling with an architectural design query, or seeking insights into any of the KX products, this forum proves highly beneficial.\\n\\nIf you haven\'t signed up yet, go and register yourself [here](https://community.kx.com)\\n\\n![KX Community](./KXCommunity1.png)\\n![KX Community](./KXCommunity2.png)\\n\\n## Stackoverflow\\n\\nIf you\'re a developer, you\'re likely familiar with StackOverflow. However, for those who may not have encountered StackOverflow before, here\'s an analogy: StackOverflow is to programmers what Google is to non-programmers - an essential website for finding answers to all your questions.\\n\\nAs of the time of this writing, StackOverflow boasts a vast repository of 23,908,328 questions spanning the realms of programming, software development, and similar domains. Out of these 23 Million questions, a mere 2,269 questions are related to KDB/Q. Yes, you read that right, meaning that only **0.0095%** of all questions on Stackoverflow are related to KDB/Q. That\'s pretty low if you ask me. To provide a comparison, consider Python, one of the widely-used mainstream programming languages, which boasts a staggering 2.1 million questions, equivalent to approximately 9%.\\n\\nThe relatively limited number of KDB/Q questions on StackOverflow is combined with a lack of a robust categorization. While I consider StackOverflow a valuable platform for posting questions, I must also acknowledge that it may not offer the same level of structured organization as the KX Community.  However, it\'s worth mentioning that there is an active participation from experienced developers who consistently respond to KDB/Q queries, and I\'ve personally come across valuable solutions and code snippets within the StackOverflow KDB/Q section as well. \\n\\nI consider Stack Overflow to be a valuable supplement to your repertoire of resources for addressing KDB/Q-related queries.\\n\\n![Stackoverflow](./Stackoverflow.png)\\n\\n## Mentorship\\n\\nAnother approach to seek solutions for your KDB/Q queries is to explore the possibility of finding a mentor. Whether you discover a mentor within your current team or organization, or seek one externally, I recommend initiating a mentor-mentee connection with an experienced KDB/Q developer. While some highly skilled KDB/Q developers may appear intimidating at first, you may be pleasantly surprised by the willingness of most of them to offer assistance and guidance.\\n\\nTo summarize, the combination of KX Community and StackOverflow, along with the option of connecting with a mentor or a knowledgeable colleague, provides a comprehensive support system to address any KDB/Q-related challenges you may encounter.\\n\\n\\nHappy Coding!"},{"id":"How to Read, Understand and Learn KDB/Q code","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/How to Read, Understand and Learn KDB/Q code","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-11-read/index.mdx","title":"How to Read, Understand and Learn KDB/Q code","description":"In my previous blog post, I shared my favourite Go-To KDB/Q Learning Resources to help you to get started.

We\'ll dissect a line of KDB/Q code that could appear complex initially - maybe we won\'t even grasp its purpose at first glance. However, by breaking it down into small, discrete expressions and evaluating them sequentially, we\'ll unravel its underlying logic and functionality.\\n\\nWe are accomplishing this by examining a fascinating pattern introduced by Stephen Taylor, the KX Librarian, as outlined in this [post](https://community.kx.com/t5/Community-Blogs/Meet-the-Zen-monks/ba-p/11604). Take a glance at the code provided below and take a moment to make an educated guess about its purpose.\\n\\n```\\nq){x{y _ x}/1 -1*(1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>x)?\'1b}\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\"\\n```\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Solution here </summary>\\n    <p>\\n      \\n      #### Did you guess right? The anonymous function (or lambda) trims all the spaces before and after the text. The ```1 function\\\\input``` pattern applies a function and not applies it\\n\\n      ```\\n      q){x{y _ x}/1 -1*(1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>x)?\'1b}\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\"\\n      \\"Trim the spaces.\\"\\n      ```\\n\\n    </p>\\n</details>\\n\\nIt\'s quite surprising how much can be achieved with such little code, isn\'t it? Now, let\'s break it down methodically, taking each component into careful consideration.\\n\\n:::caution\\nRemember, KDB/Q is evaluated left-**of**-right, meaning we have to read our code right-**to**-left. \\n:::\\n\\nThe first code section we examine is the following.\\n```\\n(expression)?\'1b\\n```\\n\\nThe \'?\' operator, along with the \'!\' operator, arguably possesses the greatest number of overloads among KDB/Q operators. In this specific context, the \'?\' operator functions as a [**\'find\'**](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/find/) operation.\\n\\nLet\'s look at an example. Suppose we have a list of integers and we would like to find the index at which that element occurs. We can do this the following way:\\n\\n:::caution\\nIndexing starts at 0 in KDB/Q\\n:::\\n\\n```\\nq)10 5 4 3 2?3  // 3 occurs at the 4th position in the list\\n3\\n```\\n\\n:::danger\\n`?` find only returns the first index of the elemnt you are searching for\\n:::\\n\\n```\\nq)10 5 4 3 2 3?3\\n3\\nq)\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\nIt\'s strongly advised to have the [KX reference card](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/) readily available, particularly when you\'re starting your KDB/Q journey and are still becoming acquainted with various operators, their overloads, and functionalities.\\n:::\\n\\n## The power of Iterators and their applications\\n\\nThe `\'` operator exemplifies another unique concept within KDB/Q, which is the concept of [iterators](https://code.kx.com/q/basics/iteration/). Iterators can be described as functions that take values as arguments and generate new functions that apply those values repetitively. In this specific instance, the `\'` operator signifies [\\"each\\"](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/maps/#each) and applies a value item-by-item to a dictionary, list, or conforming combinations of lists and dictionaries.\\n\\nAllow me to demonstrate this behavior with a straightforward example. Imagine we have a list of strings and aim to determine the length of each string:\\n\\n```\\nq)list:(\\"Hello\\";\\"World\\";\\"lorem\\";\\"ipsum\\")\\nq)count list\\n4\\n```\\nAs you can see, `count list` returns the length of the list of strings rather than the length of each individual string itself. We therefore have to use the `each` operator to achieve the desired result.\\n\\n```\\nq)count each list\\n5 5 5 5\\n```\\n\\nIn the above example we make use of the mnemonic keyword **each** which can be used to apply a unary value without having to use parentheses or brackets. We could have achieved the same result by doing the following \\n\\n:::note\\n`count` is a unary value\\n:::\\n\\n```\\nq)(count\')list\\n5 5 5 5\\nq)count\'[list]\\n5 5 5 5\\nq)count@\'list\\n5 5 5 5\\n```\\n\\nWhen examining the entire code snippet together, we can see that `(expression)?\'1b` will search (and find) the index of the first occurrence of 1b in **each** element of the list denoted by expression. Sounds complicated? Allow me to provide a demonstration for better clarity:\\n\\n```\\nq)(000101010111b;0101010101b)?\'1b\\n3 1\\n```\\n\\nOur next task is to determine the actual result of the expression enclosed within parentheses.\\n\\n```\\n(1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>x)?\'1b\\n```\\n\\nTo do so, we solely focus on the expression within parentheses and ignore the second part. We can easily do this, we already know what it does\\n\\n```\\n1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>x\\n```\\n\\nThis expression can be further divided into three components. The keyword `reverse`, the component `\\" \\"<>x` and the `\\\\`, another KDB/Q [**iterator**](https://code.kx.com/q/basics/iteration/).\\n\\nLet\'s examine each of these components separately, starting, in good KDB/Q fashion with the most right one:\\n\\n```\\nq)\\" \\"<>\\"Hello World\\"\\n11111011111b\\n```\\n\\nThe code we executed produces a boolean mask. It compares each element of the string to the empty string \\" \\" and yields \\"**true**\\" for elements that differ and \\"**false**\\" for those that are the same. Consequently, we can infer that the `<>` operator assesses inequality. If our aim is to do the opposite and examine equality, we can simply apply the equality operator, which is represented by `=`.\\n\\nThis conveys another, valuable lesson in KDB/Q, specifically: *\\"A fundamental feature of atomic functions is that their action extends automatically to the items in a list\\"* as explained in [Chapter 4: Operators](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/4_Operators/#403-extension-of-atomic-functions) of \\"Q for Mortals\\".\\n\\nDon\'t take my word for it, witness it for yourself:\\n\\n```\\nq)2 3 4+5 6 7\\n7 9 11\\n```\\n\\n:::danger\\nOf course, if you want to combine two lists they must be of the same length, otherwise KDB/Q will throw an error\\n```\\nq)2 3 4+5 6\\n\'length\\n  [0]  2 3 4+5 6\\n            ^\\n```\\n:::\\n\\nPrior to delving into the `1 function\\\\input` pattern, let\'s explore the functionality of the keyword `reverse`.\\n\\nAs you probably can guess, the keyword [`reverse`](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/reverse/) reverses the order of items of a list or dictionary.\\n\\n```\\nq)reverse \\"Hello World\\"\\n\\"dlroW olleH\\"\\nq)reverse 0 1 2 3 4 5\\n5 4 3 2 1 0\\n```\\nThe string `Hello World` becomes `dlroW olleH` and the list `0 1 2 3 4 5` becomes `5 4 3 2 1 0`\\n\\n## Exploring the versatility of Scan and Over\\n\\nNow, it\'s time to address the most intricate part of this code snippet - the `1 function\\\\input` pattern. The `\\\\` operator is referred to as \\"Scan\\". To clarify the \\"Scan\\" iterator, we must first explain the \\"Over\\" iterator. *\\"The [Over](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/6_Functions/#676-over-for-accumulation) iterator `/` is a higher-order function that provides the principal mechanism for recursion in q. In its simplest form it modifies a binary function to accumulate results over a list\\"*.\\n\\n*\\"The [Scan](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/6_Functions/#678-scan) iterator `\\\\` is a higher-order function that behaves just like `/` except that it returns all the intermediate accumulations instead of just the final one\\".* \\n\\nNow let\'s illustrate this with an example, a single line of code carries the weight of a thousand words.\\n\\nFirst, let\'s look at `Over`\\n\\n```\\nq)(+/)1 2 3 4 5\\n15\\n```\\nCan you perceive what \\"Over\\" does? It applies the binary function `+` to the list `1 2 3 4 5` and accumulates the results over the list, effectively returning the sum of all elements `1 2 3 4 5`.\\n\\nNow, let\'s look at `Scan`\\n```\\nq)(+\\\\)1 2 3 4 5\\n1 3 6 10 15\\n```\\n\\nMuch like Over, Scan also yields the cumulative sum of all elements in the list, however, with one key difference: Scan returns all intermediate steps, returning the rolling sum, rather than just the sum of all elements.\\n\\n:::info\\nThere exist two keywords for the two scenarios described above: the keyword **sum** corresponds to `(+/)` and the keyword **sums** corresponds to `(+\\\\)`.\\n:::\\n\\nHere\'s the evidence\\n\\n```\\nq)sum 1 2 3 4 5\\n15\\nq)sums 1 2 3 4 5\\n1 3 6 10 15\\n```\\n\\nBecause of KDB/Q\'s concise nature, operators have numerous overloads. This principle extends to the iterators Over and Scan. Depending on the valence (the number of inputs to a function) associated with Over or Scan, these iterators exhibit varying behavior. A comprehensive list of their behaviors can be found [here](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/iterators/)\\n\\nIn the context of the `1 function\\\\input` pattern, Scan functions similarly to what you might recognize as a \\"Do-Loop\\" in conventional programming languages. It\'s important to note that Scan will also produce the input as the initial result when applied to a unary function.\\n\\nThe following example should illustrate this behavior:\\n\\n```\\nq)5 enlist\\\\1\\n1\\n,1\\n,,1\\n,,,1\\n,,,,1\\n,,,,,1\\n\\nq)5(`f;)\\\\1\\n1\\n(`f;1)\\n(`f;(`f;1))\\n(`f;(`f;(`f;1)))\\n(`f;(`f;(`f;(`f;1))))\\n(`f;(`f;(`f;(`f;(`f;1)))))\\n```\\n\\nIn the initial example, you\'ll observe that the number 1 is enlisted five times, whereas in the second example, a nested list is generated with a depth of five levels. Both examples begin by displaying the input as the initial step.\\n\\nNow, let\'s try to put things together and see what we get. Let\'s look at the following code snippet:\\n\\n```\\nq)1 reverse\\\\\\"Hello\\"\\n\\"Hello\\"\\n\\"olleH\\"\\n```\\nAs we explained earlier, the Scan will display the input first, and then repeat the function, reverse in this case, n-times, where n is 1, resulting into a list of strings consisting of \\"Hello\\" the original string, and its reverse \\"olleH\\"\\n\\nLet\'s attempt to apply this concept to the originally provided string:  \\"     Trim spaces     \\", and apply the whole expression within parentheses\\n\\n```\\nq)1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\"\\n000111101110111111100b\\n001111111011101111000b\\n```\\nApologies if that was too swift. Let\'s break it down step by step.\\n\\n```\\nq)\\" \\"<>\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\"\\n000111101110111111100b\\n```\\n\\nThe initial segment of the expression involves a character-by-character comparison between the given input string and an empty string. It yields a boolean mask with `0b` where the elements differ and `1b` where they match. This boolean mask is subsequently utilized as input for the `1 function\\\\pattern.` In this context, Scan begins by presenting the input, followed by applying the `reverse` function precisely once.\\n\\nLet\'s combine that with the initial expression we examined, `?\'1b` find each 1b:\\n\\n```\\nq)(1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\")?\'1b\\n3 2\\n```\\n\\nUpon inspecting the two boolean masks, it becomes evident that the initial `1b` occurrence appears at index 3 in the first mask and index 2 in the second mask, respectively.\\n\\n```\\n000111101110111111100b   // first occurrence of 1b is at index 3\\n001111111011101111000b   // first occurrence of 1b is at index 2\\n```\\n\\nThe next part of the code is straightforward, we multiply 1 -1 with 3 2, REMEMBER: operators are atomic, meaning their functionality extends automatically to the items in a list. This yields the following result\\n\\n```\\nq)1 -1*(1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\")?\'1b\\n3 -2\\n```\\n\\nNext, we encounter another lambda function combined with an iterator, but in this case, it\'s Over.\\n\\n```\\nx{y _ x}/1 -1*(1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>x)?\'1b\\n```\\n\\n## Other KDB/Q operators\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look at the functionality of the operator `_` inside the lambda does: `_` also called [Drop](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/drop/), drops items from a list, entries from a dictionary or columns from a table \\n\\n:::caution\\nLet\'s avoid any confusion between **[drop](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/drop/)** and **[cut](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/cut/)** even though they are the same operator but function differently. \\n::: \\n\\nFrom the KX refernce card:\\n\\nDrop leading or trailing items\\n\\n```\\nx _ y\\t\\t_[x;y]\\n```\\n\\nWhere\\n- x is an int atom\\n- y a list or dictionary\\n\\nreturns y without the first or last x items.\\n\\nLet\'s look at an example:\\n\\n```\\nq)5_0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8      /drop the first 5 items\\n5 6 7 8\\nq)-5_0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8     /drop the last 5 items\\n0 1 2 3\\nq)1 _ `a`b`c!1 2 3\\nb| 2\\nc| 3\\n```\\n\\nNow, the remaining task is to integrate our understanding of \\"drop\\" with our knowledge of \\"Over.\\" In this scenario, \\"Over\\" is applied to a binary function where \\"drop\\" takes two parameters, `x` and `y.` Upon closer examination of the code, it\'s apparent that within the lambda, we apply `y _ x` rather than `x _ y.` However, you might be wondering about the additional `x` preceding the lambda. This variation arises from the different notation forms offered in KDB/Q. Functions can be expressed in either prefix or infix notation.\\n\\nApplication of a binary function `f` on arguments `x` and `y` is written `f[x;y]` in **prefix** or `x f y` in **infix**. Note: **infix** notation only works for Q functions, while functions defined by yourself can only be used in **prefix** notation.\\n\\nYou can find the different applications of iterators and their valence [here](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/accumulators/)\\n\\nOver applied to a binary function can be written either \\n```\\nx v2/y\\nor\\nv2/[x;y]\\n```\\n\\nmeaning that the `x` we observe in front of the lambda function `{y _ x}/` is the first parameter to the function.\\n\\n## Putting it all together\\n\\nIf we take a closer look at the entire code, we\'ll notice that the input to the primary lambda function is the string we intend to trim. Additionally, the `y` parameter in the lambda corresponds to the two indexes, 3 and -2. If you recall from the initial part of the code, when we reverse the boolean mask, we obtain the first index of a \\"true\\" flag in the \\"original\\" boolean mask and the first index of a \\"true\' flag in the \\"reversed\\" boolean mask. However, let\'s pause for a moment and consider this. The first index of a \\"true\\" flag in the \\"reversed\\" boolean mask is, in fact, the same as the first index of the \\"original\\" boolean mask when we count from the opposite end of the boolean mask (namely from the back/end).\\n\\nHaven\'t we recently discovered that \\"drop\\" used in conjunction with a negative number will discard the last \\"n\\" elements? Indeed, we have! So, the remaining piece of the puzzle is to grasp how \\"Over\\" is applied to this function. Yet, we\'re already acquainted with this concept, as \\"Over\\" serves as a higher-order function that facilitates recursion in q. In its basic form, it adapts a binary function to accumulate results over a list.\\n\\nLet\'s take a peek. To simplify matters, I\'ll display some of the intermediate outcomes rather than the entire expression\\n.\\n```\\nq)\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\"{y _ x}/3 -2\\n\\"Trim the spaces.\\"\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\nA helpful technique for debugging and comprehending the actions of \\"Over\\" is to initially employ \\"Scan\\" and examine all the interim outcomes. This can provide valuable insights into the ultimate result.\\n:::\\n\\nLet\'s give this technique a try. You can observe how \\"Scan\\" begins by removing the first three (empty) characters from the string and subsequently discards the last two (empty) characters, resulting in the desired outcome: a string that has been trimmed of all leading and trailing spaces.\\n\\n```\\nq)\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\"{y _ x}\\\\3 -2\\n\\"Trim the spaces.  \\"\\n\\"Trim the spaces.\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd there you have it! As a final step, let\'s consolidate all the code and execute it one more time, appreciating how elegantly everything aligns.\\n\\n```\\nq){x{y _ x}/1 -1*(1 reverse\\\\\\" \\"<>x)?\'1b}\\"   Trim the spaces.  \\"\\n\\"Trim the spaces.\\"\\n```\\n\\nAs an exercise, you can delve into the second code example from the original [post](https://community.kx.com/t5/Community-Blogs/Meet-the-Zen-monks/ba-p/11604) by Stephen Taylor and attempt to decipher it independently.

Borror. [Free online version](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/)\\n - [Q Tips](https://amzn.to/3UjkAgZ) by Nick Psaris \\n\\n\\n## The detailed version\\n\\nMastering KDB/Q can be quite challenging due to its steep learning curve, especially if you\'re new to vector programming languages. The resources below are designed to provide a solid foundation and help you grasp the essential concepts of the Q programming language.\\n\\n### Books\\n\\n#### Q for Mortals by Jeffry A. Borror\\n\\nIf you\'re new to the Q programming language and embarking on your learning journey, your first step should be to thoroughly read \\"Q for Mortals\\" by Jeffry A. Borror, cover to cover. This book serves as a comprehensive guide to essential q concepts and provides a strong foundation in understanding the KDB/Q database.\\n\\nBeginning with the fundamental data structures of KDB/Q, including Atoms, Lists, and Dictionaries, the book progressively introduces you to Tables, which form a core data structure in KDB/Q. It delves into intricate details about the functioning of operators, guides you through crafting your custom functions, an integral aspect of functional programming (though KDB/Q isn\'t purely functional), and illustrates the creation of derived functions using iterators, another pivotal element of KDB/Q.\\n\\nChapter 9 introduces q-sql and its role in querying and manipulating tables, while Chapter 14 offers insights into the KDB/Q database, encompassing the process of persisting data to disk. These chapters collectively provide an excellent foundational understanding of KDB/Q, making \\"Q for Mortals\\" an indispensable resource for newcomers as well as experienced developers.\\n\\nWritten in a highly accessible manner, the book is accompanied by illustrative coding examples and snippets, allowing for easy comprehension and hands-on learning. After completing a full read-through, you can revisit specific chapters whenever needed to reinforce your understanding and delve deeper into the content for a more solid grasp.\\n\\n![Q For Mortals](./qfm3.jpg)\\n\\n#### Q-Tips by Nick Psaris\\n\\nAfter reading of \\"Q for Mortals,\\" the next step is to explore my preferred KDB/Q book, \\"Q Tips,\\" authored by Nick Psaris. While \\"Q Tips\\" does offer an initial section introducing fundamental concepts and KDB/Q data structures in its initial chapters, I personally found it more advantageous to have a foundational understanding from \\"Q for Mortals\\" before delving into \\"Q Tips.\\"\\n\\nWithin the pages of this book, Nick draws upon his extensive experience and insights garnered from hands-on usage of KDB/Q within a dynamic real-world trading setting. He leads readers on a practical expedition, guiding them through the step-by-step construction of an intricate event processor in KDB/Q, right from the ground up. Nick seamlessly intertwines the fundamental elements of KDB/Q with the pertinent intricacies of market microstructure, resulting in the creation of a synthetic market data generator.\\n\\nIn this context, Nick not only illustrates how to efficiently capture, store, and analyze vast datasets, but also explains the Q programming paradigm and progressively develops the associated libraries. Throughout this journey, he weaves in well-observed and refined tips that he\'s gleaned from his own experience, ensuring readers gain comprehensive insights into the process.\\n\\nAs you can see from the image of my well-worn copy of Q-Tips below I have read the book several times from front to back and I wholeheartedly recommend Q-Tips to anyone who wants to bring their KDB/Q programming skills to the next level.\\n\\n![Q Tips](./qtips.jpg)\\n\\n### Online resources\\n\\n#### KX Academy \\n\\nIn October 2021 KX announced the launch of [KX Academy](https://kx.com/academy/), an online portal for on-demand training.

At this point, you might ask yourself what\'s next on this beautiful journey of mastering KDB/Q, which like any other skill, holds boundless potential. Moving forward,practice is key. Mastery, after all, emerges from dedicated practice. Nevertheless, I\'d like to offer you two more resources to help you on your path:\\n\\n#### KX Whitepapers\\n\\nWhitepapers are short, focused  papers explaining a particular topic in KDB/Q. These topics cover a broad spectrum, ranging from direct association with the Q programming language, its application, and interfaces to strategies for managing large data and systems. Furthermore, there exists a segment dedicated to delving into Machine Learning within the realm of KDB/Q. Notably, the complexity of these whitepapers varies significantly, with the majority catering to more seasoned developers.\\n\\nIt\'s worth mentioning that while some of these whitepapers may lack in-depth explanations of the presented code or practical implementation guidance, this should not deter you from exploring them. Below, I\'ve compiled a list of whitepapers that I\'ve personally perused and find exceptionally well-written and valuable for expanding your knowledge. Do keep in mind that I haven\'t read all whitepapers available [here](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/) and I can\'t comment on every single one of them\\n\\n - [Building real-time tick subscribers](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/rt-tick/) by Nathan Perrem\\n - [Common design principles for kdb+ gateways](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/gateway-design/) by Michael McClintock\\n - [Query Routing: A kdb+ framework for a scalable, load balanced system](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/query-routing/) by Kevin Holsgrove\\n - [Iterators](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/iterators/) by  Conor Slattery & Stephen Taylor\\n - [Parse trees and functional forms](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/parse-trees/) by Peter Storeng & Stephen Taylor\\n - [Interprocess communications](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/ipc/) by  Katrina McCormac\\n\\nI will cover some of them in future blog posts. \\n\\n#### KX Reference\\n\\nThe final resource I\'d like to introduce is akin to a Swiss pocket knife in the realm of KDB/Q learning: the KX Reference card. This invaluable tool encompasses a comprehensive compilation of KDB/Q keywords, datatypes, namespaces, operators, command-line options, and much more \u2013 the list is extensive and beyond the scope of this discussion.\\n\\nI find the Reference Card to be an indispensable asset, to the extent that I routinely keep it open in one of my web browser tabs. Whether you\'re seeking a swift verification of a keyword\'s functionality, exploring operators that align with your requirements, or revisiting subjects that may have become rusty over time, the Reference Card stands as your go-to resource.\\n\\n![KX Reference](./reference.png)\\n\\nAnd thus, we conclude our journey.
