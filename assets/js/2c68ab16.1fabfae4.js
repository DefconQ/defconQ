Whether you\'re an aspiring KDB/Q developer looking to become a full-time role, a software developer from another programming background, a quant wanting to efficiently query and analyze data or even implement business logic such as Trade Cost Analysis (TCA), Price Impact Modelling or Hitratio calculations, or if you are a data/business analyst needing to work with KDB/Q databases\u2014we\u2019ve got you covered. For each of these roles, we provide a tailored study plan. To help you choose the best path, I\u2019ll include a description of each job role along with the corresponding study plan. Since everyone learns at their own pace and I don\'t know your specific situation\u2014whether you\'re a student or graduate aiming to become a full-time KDB/Q developer with several hours a day to study, or an experienced developer who only needs to interact with KDB/Q occasionally and has just a few hours a week to learn\u2014I won\'t provide an exact timeline for your study path. However, I believe that with consistent effort, you can develop a solid understanding of KDB/Q within two to three months and reach a level where you can be quite productive.","slug":"/category/kdbq-study-roadmap","permalink":"/docs/category/kdbq-study-roadmap","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Intro","permalink":"/docs/intro"},"next":{"title":"Choosing the Right KDB/Q Study Plan","permalink":"/docs/studyPlan/intro"}}}')}}]);
