However, understanding and familiarizing oneself with the syntax is merely the beginning. To truly master any programming language, one needs a deep understanding of its core concepts and paradigms. For instance, when learning object-oriented languages like Java or C++, you should focus on concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and data abstraction. Additionally, understanding pointers and memory allocation is crucial for mastering C++. The same principle applies to KDB/Q, a high-performance, in-memory database and programming language. In this blog post, I will share the seven most important concepts that will set you apart and enhance your skills as a KDB/Q developer. Understanding these concepts will provide insight into why KDB/Q is so powerful and favored among quants and data enthusiasts.","datePublished":"2024-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexander Unterrainer","description":"DefconQ, KDB/Q Developer, Consultant","url":"https://github.com/AUnterrainer","image":"/img/alex.jpeg"},"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","mainEntityOfPage":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","url":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","headline":"DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","name":"DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q","description":"In this blog post, I have a special treat for you.

After completing all the onboarding, installing Microsoft Visual Studio and gaining access to my team's codebase, I was finally able to have a look at the project I was going to work on. Little did I know, what nightmare I was about to face. Upon opening the project, I discovered that the average length of each class exceeded 15 thousand lines. Yes, you read that correctly; it's not a typo, but the shocking reality I was faced with. Navigating the code base was hard enough, but making a change without breaking anything seemed to be impossible. Luckily, I eventually transitioned to a team that embraced the concept of code organization.","datePublished":"2024-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexander Unterrainer","description":"DefconQ, KDB/Q Developer, Consultant","url":"https://github.com/AUnterrainer","image":"/img/alex.jpeg"},"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/DefconQ at Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q by Habla Computing","mainEntityOfPage":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/DefconQ at Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q by Habla Computing","url":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/DefconQ at Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q by Habla Computing","headline":"DefconQ at 'Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q' by Habla Computing","name":"DefconQ at 'Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q' by Habla Computing","description":"Mid January, I stumbled upon a KDB/Q meetup hosted by Habla Computing in Madrid, boasting an interesting lineup of talks and speakers. Spontaneously, I opted to seize the opportunity and booked a trip to the sunny capital of Spain to attend the event. Following the meetup, during the networking session, I had the pleasure of meeting Juan, a founding partner of Habla Computing, and Jesus, the VP of Research at Habla Computing, who warmly welcomed me into the small, but growing, Spanish KDB/Q community. Engaged in a stimulating conversation about our mutual enthusiasm for KDB/Q, Juan and Jesus extended a kind invitation for me to speak at their upcoming conference, an offer I eagerly embraced. Not only did I feel honoured to have the opportunity to share my expertise on KDB/Q, but I also take every chance to escape the rainy weather of the UK and spend some time in Spain.","datePublished":"2024-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexander Unterrainer","description":"DefconQ, KDB/Q Developer, Consultant","url":"https://github.com/AUnterrainer","image":"/img/alex.jpeg"},"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/The importance of code review - Four eyes see more than two","mainEntityOfPage":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/The importance of code review - Four eyes see more than two","url":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/The importance of code review - Four eyes see more than two","headline":"The importance of code review - Four eyes see more than two","name":"The importance of code review - Four eyes see more than two","description":"Over the weekend, I performed an update on the version of Docusaurus, the documentation framework utilized for my blog. A major update had been released some time ago, and due to my limited enthusiasm for front-end development, I had been postponing this task as long as possible. However, I finally decided to tackle it this weekend. After reviewing the recommended upgrade instructions provided in the official documentation, I prepared all necessary steps and then started the upgrade. Incrementally I went through all steps, running my blog locally on my laptop, ensuring that I wouldn't break anything. After completing the upgrade, I conducted one final verification to confirm that everything was running as expected in my browser. Satisfied with the results, I committed my changes and pushed them to the repository of my blog.","datePublished":"2024-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexander Unterrainer","description":"DefconQ, KDB/Q Developer, Consultant","url":"https://github.com/AUnterrainer","image":"/img/alex.jpeg"},"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","mainEntityOfPage":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","url":"https://DefconQ.github.io/blog/Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","headline":"Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","name":"Advent of Code -  Daily Coding Practice","description":"It's this time of the year again: it's getting cold and dark outside, the days are getting shorter, Chris Rea is driving home, Santa is coming coming to town and all Mariah Carey wants for Christmas is you.

they are often intimidated by its &quot;strange&quot; syntax, which differs significantly from most other programming languages they&#x27;ve seen. However, understanding and familiarizing oneself with the syntax is merely the beginning. To truly master any programming language, one needs a deep understanding of its core concepts and paradigms. For instance, when learning object-oriented languages like Java or C++, you should focus on concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and data abstraction. Additionally, understanding pointers and memory allocation is crucial for mastering C++. The same principle applies to KDB/Q, a high-performance, in-memory database and programming language. In this blog post, I will share the seven most important concepts that will set you apart and enhance your skills as a KDB/Q developer. Understanding these concepts will provide insight into why KDB/Q is so powerful and favored among quants and data enthusiasts.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/kdb-q">kdb/q</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/kdb-q-concepts">kdb/q concepts</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about The Magnificent Seven - Mastering KDB/Q Concepts for Data Excellence" href="/blog/The Magnificent Seven - Mastering KDB/Q Concepts for Data Excellence"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q">DefconQ meets Fancy Quant - Alexander Unterrainer and Dimitri Bianco discuss KDB/Q</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-07-01T00:00:00.000Z">July 1, 2024</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/AUnterrainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="/img/alex.jpeg" alt="Alexander Unterrainer"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/AUnterrainer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Alexander Unterrainer</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle">DefconQ, KDB/Q Developer, Consultant</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>In this blog post, I have a special treat for you.

After completing all the onboarding, installing Microsoft Visual Studio and gaining access to my team&#x27;s codebase, I was finally able to have a look at the project I was going to work on. Little did I know, what nightmare I was about to face. Upon opening the project, I discovered that the average length of each class exceeded 15 thousand lines. Yes, you read that correctly; it&#x27;s not a typo, but the shocking reality I was faced with. Navigating the code base was hard enough, but making a change without breaking anything seemed to be impossible.

A major update had been released some time ago, and due to my limited enthusiasm for front-end development, I had been postponing this task as long as possible. However, I finally decided to tackle it this weekend. After reviewing the recommended upgrade instructions provided in the official documentation, I prepared all necessary steps and then started the upgrade. Incrementally I went through all steps, running my blog locally on my laptop, ensuring that I wouldn&#x27;t break anything. After completing the upgrade, I conducted one final verification to confirm that everything was running as expected in my browser. Satisfied with the results, I committed my changes and pushed them to the repository of my blog.</p>
<p>Now, all that remained was deploying the new version to <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Pages</a>. I executed the command <code>USE_SSH=true yarn deploy</code> as I typically do, pressed enter, and awaited the customary <code>[INFO]</code> messages.
