Mid January, I stumbled upon a KDB/Q meetup hosted by [Habla Computing](https://hablapps.com) in Madrid, boasting an interesting lineup of talks and speakers. Spontaneously, I opted to seize the opportunity and booked a trip to the sunny capital of Spain to attend the event. Following the meetup, during the networking session, I had the pleasure of meeting [Juan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jserranohidalgo/), a founding partner of Habla Computing, and [Jesus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesús-lópez-gonzález-98237248/), the VP of Research at Habla Computing, who warmly welcomed me into the small, but growing, Spanish KDB/Q community. Engaged in a stimulating conversation about our mutual enthusiasm for KDB/Q, Juan and Jesus extended a kind invitation for me to speak at their upcoming conference, an offer I eagerly embraced. Not only did I feel honoured to have the opportunity to share my expertise on KDB/Q, but I also take every chance to escape the rainy weather of the UK and spend some time in Spain.

## Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q - The Event

The long-awaited premiere of "Everything, Everywhere, All with KDB/Q" occurred on April 3rd, drawing a significant crowd of over one hundred online participants and 30 individuals who joined in person, making it a great success. During my presentation I shared some tips and trick for how to get started with KDB/Q as well as some insights into how to read, understand and learn KDB/Q, a topic I discussed in more details in one of my blog post available [here](https://www.defconq.tech/blog/How%20to%20Read,%20Understand%20and%20Learn%20KDB/Q%20code). I was joined on stage by amazing colleagues and peers of the KDB/Q industry, including [Zan Buchanan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zan-buchanan-33b5a8148/) from [Data Intellect](https://dataintellect.com), along with [Aoife Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aoife-clarke-638188136/) and [Rebecca Kelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyr13/) from [INQDATA](https://www.inqdata.ai).

### [DefconQ](https://defconq.tech)

If you've stumbled upon this blog post, chances are you're already familiar with DefconQ. However, if this happens to be your first visit, allow me to offer a brief introduction. DefconQ is a technology blog dedicated to all things KDB/Q. Initially conceived to aid individuals in grasping the fundamentals of KDB/Q, my aim is to simplify the complexities of the Q programming language, along with essential KDB/Q language and architecture concepts. Encountering challenges during my own journey with KDB/Q and grappling with its steep learning curve, I founded DefconQ—a KDB/Q tech blog that I wished had existed when I first embarked on this endeavor.

## The Hosts - [Habla Computing](https://hablapps.com)

Finally, I'm excited to introduce the host of this fantastic event: [Habla Computing](https://hablapps.com), your trusted companion in software architecture. Led by Juan, the founding partner, and Jesus, the VP of Research, Habla Computing drives digital transformation through functional programming and language-driven architectures. Among their array (pun intended) of services, Habla Computing offers:

- Architecture: You can count on their knowledge and experience in designing well-founded libraries, frameworks and applications, to grow your codebase from a solid start or re-engineer major components from solid principles
- Consulting: Habla Computing helps companies to ensure that technology issues are kept under control during the whole project life-cycle. 
- Training: Condensed training in Scala and KDB/Q as well as tailor-maded courses for you or your development team.

## Conclusion

In summary, the event was a resounding success. Although the turnout in Madrid could have been higher, we were delighted to be joined by over a hundred attendees online from various corners of the globe. The lower attendance in Madrid can be attributed to competing events and the allure of enjoying the event from the comfort of one's home. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed meeting colleagues and peers and had a great time presenting. It's inspiring to witness the expansion of the KDB/Q community beyond traditional financial hubs like London or New York. Additionally, I'm pleased to see the growing presence of female developers, highlighted by the fact that I was the only male speaker at the event. I am eagerly looking forward to many more events like this and I am committed to attending, whether as a speaker or as an attendee. .
