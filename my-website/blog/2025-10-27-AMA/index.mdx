As promised, I’m hosting a **Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything)** on **November 13th, 2025**, where I will be answering ***all*** your questions about **KDB/Q**, the world’s most powerful time-series database and array programming language.

Over the years, I’ve received countless messages about:

- 💡 How to start learning KDB/Q
- 🚀 Career paths and progression in the KDB/Q ecosystem
- 📚 Best learning resources and study plans
- ⚙️  Real-world applications and architecture insights

So instead of replying to everyone one by one, let’s bring it all together. The AMA will run for **24 hours**, and you will be able to ask your questions **completely anonymously**.

Looking forward to hearing from you all!

**DefconQ**
