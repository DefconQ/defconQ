In this blog post, I have a special treat for you. I sat down with [Dimitri Bianco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-bianco/) a seasoned quant who runs his own podcast and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DimitriBianco)  dedicated to all things quant finance. I have been following Dimitri for a while and always found his podcasts incredibly informative and helpful, so when the opportunity to join him on a podcast and discuss KDB/Q came up, I couldn't turn it down. Dimitriâ€™s engagement provides graduates and students at the start of their careers with valuable insights to help them choose the right path. While I had to figure most things out on my own, Dimitri's podcast offers a valuable industry perspective into the field of quantitative finance.

## Talking Tuesdays: Fancy Quant meets DefconQ

Dimitri and I sat down for a chat about KDB/Q, a vector-oriented programming language. We discussed what it is, why it's so performant, its applications, and its significance in finance, particularly in quantitative finance. We also touched on the hiring process for graduates, remote work, and much more. If you missed the podcast, you can find the recording below and on [Dimitri's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DimitriBianco).
