Last week, I had the honour of making my first solo appearance on the ArrayCast podcast, a show dedicated to everything array programming, and a tribute to the legacy of [Kenneth E. Iverson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson), the legendary creator of APL. While I‚Äôve previously been part of a group discussion during last year‚Äôs [Iverson College](https://iversoncollege.com) event, this was my first time flying solo.

As many of you know, KDB/Q is a direct descendant of [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)), so it naturally finds a regular place in ArrayCast conversations. Over the years, the podcast has featured some of the most respected names in the KDB/Q community, including [Nick Psaris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpsaris/), [Attila Vrabecz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/attila-v-b948a52/), [Jonny Press](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonny-press-7005602/) and [Stevan Apter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevan-apter-1ba50488/), which makes it an even greater privilege to join this esteemed list of guests and contribute to such a meaningful initiative.

## What Are Array Programming Languages?

Array programming languages, like APL, J, and K (the foundation of KDB/Q), are designed to operate on entire sets of data, **arrays**, with a single, concise expression. Unlike traditional languages that loop through elements one by one, array languages apply operations across whole vectors, matrices, or tables at once. This leads to **massive gains in performance, readability, and expressiveness.**  Their power lies in **thinking and coding at a higher level of abstraction**, closer to how data is naturally structured, making them a perfect choice in fields like quantitative finance, analytics, and high-performance computing. **Fewer lines, faster code, smarter execution.**

## [The Array Cast](https://www.arraycast.com)

The **Array Cast** is a podcast dedicated to the fascinating world of **array programming languages**, from [**APL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and [**J**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)) to [**K**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)), [**Q**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)), and beyond. Hosted by [Conor Hoekstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorhoekstra/), a well-known voice in the programming language community, the show features an expert panel including [Ad√°m Brudzewsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrudz/) (APL), [Stephen Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/) (APL, Q), [Marshall Lochbaum](https://www.dyalog.com/dyalogue-newsletters.htm?nl=27&a=162) (J, APL, BQN), and [Bob Therriault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-therriault-a096602b7/) (J). Together, they dive deep into the design, philosophy, and power of array-oriented programming, but always in a way that's engaging, insightful, and often entertaining. Even if you‚Äôve never written a line of APL or Q, the Array Cast is worth your time: it offers a fresh perspective on problem solving, language design, and computational thinking that anyone in tech can appreciate.
