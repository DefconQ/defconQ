September is going to be a busy one. Just in time for **DefconQ‚Äôs 2nd birthday**,  we‚Äôre hosting **not one, but two Happy Hours**, on two different continents! I‚Äôm thrilled to announce the **Brews & Qs: Belfast Edition üçª**, hosted by **DefconQ** and kindly sponsored by [**KX**](https://kx.com).

Join us for a relaxed evening of conversation, community, and cocktails at the KX Happy Hour, a casual meetup for **KDB/Q developers** to network, swap stories, and share ideas. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned veteran or just starting out, this is a great opportunity to connect with others who speak your language (literally).

This session‚Äôs conversation starter: the [**public preview of KDB-X Community Edition**](https://kdb-x.kx.com/sign-in). We‚Äôll chat about what‚Äôs new, how it might fit into your projects, and hear perspectives from fellow developers, all in an open, informal setting.

No slides, no agenda, just great conversations, good company, and a chance to strengthen your KDB-X/Q network.
