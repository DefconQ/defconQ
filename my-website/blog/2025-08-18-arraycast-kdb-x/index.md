Because of a scheduling conflict and the unavailability of Stephen Taylor, panelist of the well-known **ArrayCast**, I had the privilege of stepping in for my third appearance, this time as a (guest) panelist. Or, as the former ice hockey player in me would say, I got called up as the backup goalie.

In this episode, we welcomed [Ashok Reddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/areddy/), **CEO of KX**, who shared insights on the newly released **KDB-X Community Edition**. We covered the motivations behind this move, the current state of the community edition, and what‚Äôs coming next on the roadmap.

If you‚Äôre curious about KDB/Q, what the new community edition brings to the table, and our broader discussion, I highly recommend tuning in.

## What Are Array Programming Languages?

Array programming languages, like APL, J, and K (the foundation of KDB/Q), are designed to operate on entire sets of data, **arrays**, with a single, concise expression. Unlike traditional languages that loop through elements one by one, array languages apply operations across whole vectors, matrices, or tables at once. This leads to **massive gains in performance, readability, and expressiveness.**  Their power lies in **thinking and coding at a higher level of abstraction**, closer to how data is naturally structured, making them a perfect choice in fields like quantitative finance, analytics, and high-performance computing. **Fewer lines, faster code, smarter execution.**

## [The Array Cast](https://www.arraycast.com)

The **Array Cast** is a podcast dedicated to the fascinating world of **array programming languages**, from [**APL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and [**J**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)) to [**K**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)), [**Q**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)), and beyond. Hosted by [Conor Hoekstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorhoekstra/), a well-known voice in the programming language community, the show features an expert panel including [Ad√°m Brudzewsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrudz/) (APL), [Stephen Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/) (APL, Q), [Marshall Lochbaum](https://www.dyalog.com/dyalogue-newsletters.htm?nl=27&a=162) (J, APL, BQN), and [Bob Therriault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-therriault-a096602b7/) (J). Together, they dive deep into the design, philosophy, and power of array-oriented programming, but always in a way that's engaging, insightful, and often entertaining. Even if you‚Äôve never written a line of APL or Q, the Array Cast is worth your time: it offers a fresh perspective on problem solving, language design, and computational thinking that anyone in tech can appreciate.
