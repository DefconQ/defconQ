# Streaming Smarter: Real-Time Market Data with Kola, Python, and Databento

A few weeks back, I shared a blog post on how to stream [real-time data from Yahoo Finance](https://www.defconq.tech/docs/tutorials/realTimeStocks) into KDB using Python and the yfinance API. Following that, my former colleague [Nathan Swann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-swann-568765257/), instead of using `qpython`, why not try the `kola` API? 

![Nathan Swann suggestion](./img/nathan.png)

This is a perfect example of the power of the KDB/Q community, sharing knowledge, tools, and better ways to do things. So, you asked, and we delivered. I gave `kola` a try, refactored the code to use it instead of `qpython`, and was impressed with the results.

But I didn’t stop there. One of the limitations of using Yahoo Finance is the restriction on request volume, a real challenge for real-time data feeds. So I explored other options and found a great alternative: [Databento](https://databento.com), a modern market data provider offering **$125 in free credits** for new users.

In this updated blog post, I walk through how to:

- Replace `qpython` with `kola`
- Swap out **Yahoo Finance** for **Databento**
- Build a flexible, scalable pipeline from real-time data sources into KDB

It’s a great demonstration of just how powerful and adaptable KDB/Q is, easily integrating with other programming languages and data providers.


## Meet Kola: The Blazing-Fast Python Interface for KDB/Q You Didn’t Know You Needed

Kola is a free and open-source Python interface for KDB/Q designed with performance and modern development in mind. Built on top of [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org) or speed and using [**Polars**](https://pola.rs) for ultra-fast DataFrame operations, Kola delivers a powerful and efficient toolkit for working with KDB data in Python.

The project is the brainchild of [Jo Shinonome](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshinonome/), a well-known contributor to the KDB/Q ecosystem and the developer behind the popular [KDB/Q plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/jshinonome/vscode-q). Kola combines his deep understanding of both KDB/Q and modern Python tooling.

If you’re looking for a high-performance alternative to `qpython` or simply want a more efficient and modern way to work with KDB/Q in Python, Kola is worth checking out. You can explore the source code on [Jo’s GitHub](https://github.com/jshinonome) and read more about Kola’s performance and internals in this excellent [Timestored blog post](https://www.timestored.com/kdb-guides/kola-python-api).

Whether you’re building research tools, ingesting real-time data, or just tinkering with KDB from Python, Kola is a fantastic addition to your toolbox.

### How do you install Kola?

Just like any standard Python library, getting started with Kola is incredibly simple. All it takes is a quick `pip install` and you're ready to roll. Since Kola is built on top of Polars, the Polars library will be automatically installed alongside it, no extra steps needed.

```
pip install kola
```

## Lean, Mean, and Lightning Fast: Upgrading Your KDB/Q Pipeline with Kola and Polars

We’ve built on the foundation laid in the previous tutorial, this time, with some powerful upgrades. With just a few strategic changes, we replaced legacy components and supercharged our pipeline using modern tools. Specifically, we phased out `qpython` in favour of `kola`, and swapped out `pandas` for `polars`.

These updates require minimal code changes but deliver significant improvements in performance and memory efficiency. If you've been following my blog, you’ll find the transition straightforward. Here's a breakdown of the core modifications:

### 🔄  Key Changes

1. Switched from `pandas` to `polars`
2. Replaced `qpython` with `kola`

### ⚡ Benefits of the Upgrade

- **🚀 Performance**: Polars is optimized for speed and easily outperforms pandas in most scenarios
- **🧠 Memory Efficiency**: Handles large datasets with significantly lower memory overhead
- **🔗 Simpler Integration**: Kola provides a more elegant and modern interface to interact with KDB/Q

You can find the complete, updated source code on my [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/DefconQ/defconQ/tree/master/projects/realTimeStock).

## Plug & Play: Launching Your Upgraded Market Data Stack

Getting your upgraded stack up and running is just as simple as before. The beauty of this new setup is that you don’t need to modify anything on the KDB/Q side. All the improvements happen in the Python layer, just swap in the new kola-based feed handler in place of the old one, and you're good to go.

Here’s how to get started:

We first start our Tickerplant, which loads the table schema we are already familiar with. 

```
alexanderunterrainer@Mac:~/repos/defconQ/projects/realTimeStock|master⚡ ⇒  qq tick_kola.q sym -p 5010
```

```

q)stocks
time sym feedHandlerTime open high low close volume bid ask bidSize askSize
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
q)
```

Once the Tickerplant is running, we confirm the schema has loaded correctly. Next, we spin up the Real-Time Database (RDB)

```
alexanderunterrainer@Mac:~/repos/defconQ/projects/realTimeStock|master⚡ ⇒  qq tick/r.q :5010 -p 5011
```

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
q)count stocks

```

Last but not least, we launch our Python data feed.

```
alexanderunterrainer@Mac:~/repos/defconQ/projects/realTimeStock|master⚡ ⇒  python3 yahoo_finance_streamer_kola.py --tickers tickers.csv
```

```

## Integrating Databento into Your Real-Time KDB/Q Stack

To integrate Databento into our real-time KDB/Q tick stack, I made a few small but impactful updates to the codebase. You can find the latest version on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DefconQ/defconQ/tree/master/projects/realTimeStock). The main changes are as follows:

- **Schema Alignment**: Updated the table schema to match Databento’s format for seamless compatibility.
- **Renamed Table**: Changed the table name from `stocks` to `trades` to reflect the new data source.
- **Removed Yahoo Finance Dependency**: Dropped all `yfinance` imports and related logic.
- **Databento Integration**: Added support for the `databento` client, including authentication and stream setup.
- **Simplified Ticker Input**: Replaced CSV-based ticker loading with command-line argument support.
- **KDB+ Compatibility**: Retained all existing kola-based streaming functionality to ensure a smooth connection with KDB+.

This integration makes our real-time app more flexible, scalable, and production-ready, powered by high-quality data and a fast, modern toolchain.

## Kola Meets Databento: Powering Your Real-Time KDB/Q Stack

Let’s bring everything together and launch our updated KDB/Q tick stack with full support for Kola and Databento. We begin by starting the modified Tickerplant, which loads the updated table schema aligned with Databento’s format.

```
alexanderunterrainer@Mac:~/repos/defconQ/projects/realTimeStock|master⚡ ⇒  qq tick_databento.q sym_databento -p 5010
```

```

q)trades
ts_event rtype publisher_id instrument_id action side depth price size flags ts_in_delta sequence symbol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

Once the Tickerplant is running, we confirm the schema has loaded correctly. Next, we spin up the Real-Time Database (RDB) and verify it has picked up the new schema and is ready to receive data, checking the table count as a quick sanity check.

```
alexanderunterrainer@Mac:~/repos/defconQ/projects/realTimeStock|master⚡ ⇒  qq tick_databento/r.q :5010 -p 5011
```

```

```
Finally, we launch our Python data feed, which streams real-time market data directly from Databento into our stack.

```
