# Intro

Before we can start learning KDB/Q we first need to have a running version of q installed. Let's kickstart our journey! Please note, I will only cover the installation for personal use. If you are trying to install a commercial version of KDB/Q, please follow the guide on [code.kx.com](www.code.kx.com).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to install is to head over to [code.kx.com](www.code.kx.com) and follow the installation guide [here](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/install/). However, for simplicity I will also include the steps here. 

At the time of writing, KX offers a 64-bit Personal Edition for non-commerical use. This version of KDB/Q is not licenced for cloud usage and requires an internet connection to be run. 

## Step 1: Downloading KDB/Q

Head over to code.kx.com and download the current version of KDB/Q from [here](https://kx.com/kdb-personal-edition-download/). KX offers a version for all three main operating systems: Linux, macOS or Winwos.

After completing the download form, the download should kick off and you should receive an email with your ```kc.lic``` licence file

## Step 2: Unzip your download

:::caution
Here we assume you install kdb+ in your `HOME` directory on Linux or macOS; or in `C:\` on Windows, and set the environment variable `QHOME` accordingly.
:::

```txt
os        QHOME
---------------
Linux     ~/q
macOS     ~/q
Windows   c:\q
```

:::info
You can install kdb+ anywhere as long as you set the path in QHOME.
:::

Open a command shell and cd to your downloads directory.

Unzip the downloaded ZIP to produce a folder q in your install location.

<Tabs groupId="operating-system">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
    unzip l64.zip -d $HOME/q
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">
    unzip m64.zip -d $HOME/q
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    Expand-Archive w64.zip -DestinationPath C:\q
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
