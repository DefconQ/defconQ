# Welcome 
Welcome to DefconQ, a tech blog dedicated to everyone who is eager to demystify KDB and tackle the challenges encountered while doing so. While the typical route into this corner of software development and programming languages might be by joining one of the two major consultancy firms as a graduate developer, we try to provide insights coming from a fully self-learner perspective. We try to break down complex concepts as easy as possible help to overcome the steep learning curve of KDB providing simple and concrete examples, making this ourney accessible to anyone with the grit to dive in.

Happy Learning
