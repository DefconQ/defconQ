<p>If you've stumbled upon this blog post, chances are you're already familiar with DefconQ. However, if this happens to be your first visit, allow me to offer a brief introduction. DefconQ is a technology blog dedicated to all things KDB/Q. Initially conceived to aid individuals in grasping the fundamentals of KDB/Q, my aim is to simplify the complexities of the Q programming language, along with essential KDB/Q language and architecture concepts. Encountering challenges during my own journey with KDB/Q and grappling with its steep learning curve, I founded DefconQ—a KDB/Q tech blog that I wished had existed when I first embarked on this endeavor.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-hosts---habla-computing">The Hosts - <a href="https://hablapps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habla Computing</a><a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/DefconQ%20at%20Everything,%20Everywhere,%20All%20with%20KDB/Q%20by%20Habla%20Computing#the-hosts---habla-computing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-hosts---habla-computing" title="Direct link to the-hosts---habla-computing">​</a></h2>
<p>Finally, I'm excited to introduce the host of this fantastic event: <a href="https://hablapps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habla Computing</a>, your trusted companion in software architecture. Led by Juan, the founding partner, and Jesus, the VP of Research, Habla Computing drives digital transformation through functional programming and language-driven architectures. Among their array (pun intended) of services, Habla Computing offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture: You can count on their knowledge and experience in designing well-founded libraries, frameworks and applications, to grow your codebase from a solid start or re-engineer major components from solid principles</li>
<li>Consulting: Habla Computing helps companies to ensure that technology issues are kept under control during the whole project life-cycle.</li>
<li>Training: Condensed training in Scala and KDB/Q as well as tailor-maded courses for you or your development team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/DefconQ%20at%20Everything,%20Everywhere,%20All%20with%20KDB/Q%20by%20Habla%20Computing#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>In summary, the event was a resounding success. Although the turnout in Madrid could have been higher, we were delighted to be joined by over a hundred attendees online from various corners of the globe. The lower attendance in Madrid can be attributed to competing events and the allure of enjoying the event from the comfort of one's home. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed meeting colleagues and peers and had a great time presenting. It's inspiring to witness the expansion of the KDB/Q community beyond traditional financial hubs like London or New York. Additionally, I'm pleased to see the growing presence of female developers, highlighted by the fact that I was the only male speaker at the event. I am eagerly looking forward to many more events like this and I am committed to attending, whether as a speaker or as an attendee. .</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, I performed an update on the version of <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>, the documentation framework utilized for my blog. A major update had been released some time ago, and due to my limited enthusiasm for front-end development, I had been postponing this task as long as possible. However, I finally decided to tackle it this weekend. After reviewing the recommended upgrade instructions provided in the official documentation, I prepared all necessary steps and then started the upgrade. Incrementally I went through all steps, running my blog locally on my laptop, ensuring that I wouldn't break anything. After completing the upgrade, I conducted one final verification to confirm that everything was running as expected in my browser. Satisfied with the results, I committed my changes and pushed them to the repository of my blog.</p>
<p>Now, all that remained was deploying the new version to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Pages</a>. I executed the command <code>USE_SSH=true yarn deploy</code> as I typically do, pressed enter, and awaited the customary <code>[INFO]</code> messages. However, instead of the expected outcome, I was confronted with a bright, red error message.</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[ERROR] Deployment of the build output failed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Error: Running "git push" command failed. </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Does the GitHub user account you are using have push access to the repository?</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Ugh, of course. Something went wrong. However, my blog ran smoothly locally. I meticulously reviewed all my steps again, compared the <code>docusaurus.config.js</code> file with the new <code>docusaurus.config.ts</code> script I had to generate as part of the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript. Everything appeared to be in order. So why wasn't it functioning properly? The error message resembled an <code>SSH</code> issue, prompting me to double-check all my GIT configurations, and even recreate <code>SSH</code> keys, but to nothing.</p>
<p>Then, I proceeded with the typical routine every developer follows when encountering an issue: I searched for help on the internet, StackOverflow, Google search, blogs, forums, but unfortunately, none of the resources I explored offered a solution to my dilemma. Eventually, I stumbled upon a post suggesting that I delete the gh-pages branch of my repository — the branch responsible for hosting my blog online - and recreating it might resolve the issue. This sounded like a plausible remedy, so I proceeded accordingly. Regrettably, the solution did not rectify my problem; in fact, it exacerbated it. Deleting the branch responsible for hosting my blog rendered it inaccessible. While I may not boast millions of readers, the embarrassment of visitors encountering an offline blog was real.</p>
<p>I began to feel a tinge of concern and proceeded to review everything one more time, attempting a few additional troubleshooting steps, but nothing worked. At this point, my last resort was seeking assistance from a more seasoned developer. Fortunately, one of my close friends from university happened to be one of those exceptional talents - often referred to as <strong>10X developers</strong> in the tech industry. Regardless of the topic at hand, he possessed the ability to grasp concepts within minutes. Most technical challenges that had stumped me in the past seemed trivial to him. While the only programming language he wasn't well-versed in happened to be KDB/Q, I was fortunate that this particular issue did not pertain to that domain. Armed with a few screenshots and a concise explanation detailing my efforts and attempted solutions, I composed a message and eagerly awaited his response.</p>
<p>Knowing that he had recently welcomed his second child and that my trivial web development issues were understandably not a priority compared to his new responsibilities, I decided to take a leisurely stroll with my girlfriend and some friends. Several hours later, I received a response from him—a few links to potential solutions, all of which I had already explored. Following that, he inquired about my GIT repository URL, username, and a few other details. After confirming these details, I received a smiley face emoji in response. It was then pointed out to me that I had a typo in my GIT username—I had mistakenly written De<strong>c</strong>fonQ rather than De<strong>f</strong>conQ. With this embarrassing oversight corrected, I was finally able to deploy my blog once again, and it was back up and running as usual.</p>
<p>This experience, reminded me once again, about the significance of code review and why it should be an integral part of every software development life cycle. Which brings me to the main topic of this blog post: <strong>code review</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-code-review-and-why-you-should-practice-it">What is code review and why you should practice it<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/The%20importance%20of%20code%20review%20-%20Four%20eyes%20see%20more%20than%20two#what-is-code-review-and-why-you-should-practice-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is code review and why you should practice it" title="Direct link to What is code review and why you should practice it">​</a></h2>
<p>In the software development industry, code review is a fundamental practice that involves systematically examining code changes made by developers. It serves as a crucial quality assurance measure, ensuring that code meets standards, is free of bugs, and aligns with project requirements. Code review is important for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, it provides an opportunity for developers to have their code reviewed by their peers ensuring certain <strong>quality standards and controls</strong>, receiving valuable feedback on potential improvements or adherence to best practices.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing and transferring knowledge</strong>: Code reviews are a great opportunity to share or gain expertise. The depth of this knowledge transfer varies widely, however, there will always be some level of information exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Spreading ownership</strong>: Code reviews  allow developers to review code written by others, facilitating learning and deeper understanding of the system being developed. This will foster mutual code ownership. It's common for a developer to become solely responsible for a specific part of the codebase due to their familiarity with it. While this might offer short-term advantages, it often leads to long-term drawbacks. When ownership of the code is shared among team members, it promotes motivation and autonomy within the team.</li>
<li>Moreover, code review encourages <strong>collaboration</strong> within teams, as developers can provide constructive feedback to one another and engage in discussions about software development practices.</li>
<li><strong>Unify development styles</strong>: Each developer has their unique approaches and preferences when it comes to implementing software. Code reviews play a crucial role in bridging the gap between individual development styles, thereby promoting a more unified codebase. This unification occurs through both high-level discussions concerning architecture and software design, as well as micro-level continuous integration checks like enforcing coding style consistency.</li>
<li>For junior developers, code review offers a unique chance to benefit from the experience and expertise of more seasoned developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a comprehensive guide on code reviews and best practices, make sure to read the excellent article <a href="https://www.swarmia.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-code-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"A Complete Guide to Code Review"</a> by Kimmo Brunfeldt.</p>
<p>Ultimately, no code should be deployed to a production environment without undergoing a formal code review and obtaining the approval of at least two other developers, a best practice that development teams should adhere to. <strong>DefconQ</strong> on the other hand, will simply postpone future front end updates or outsource it to an experts. Volunteers are more than welcome.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's this time of the year again: it's getting cold and dark outside, the days are getting shorter, Chris Rea is driving home, Santa is coming coming to town and all Mariah Carey wants for Christmas is you. As business requests hopefully slow down, and we enter code freeze, it's a good time to reflect on the past year and spend some time on sharpening our brains and KDB/Q coding skills. And what could possibly be better for that than tackling the daily coding challenges presented by <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advent of Code</a>?</p>
<p>Advent of Code is a daily coding challenge presented in the form of an advent calendar, running from December 1st to Christmas Day, December 25th. Initially created in 2015 by <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Wastl</a>, it has become widely popular among programmers across various programming languages.</p>
<p>The challenges are in form of small programming puzzles designed for diverse skill sets and levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. Participants use these puzzles for interview preparation, company training, university coursework, practice problems, engaging in speed contests, or challenging one another. You also don't need a computer science background in order to participate; a basic understanding of programming and some problem-solving skills are sufficient to make progress. Moreover, a high-end computer is not a requirement; each problem is designed to have a solution that runs within 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>Each day at midnight EST, a new problem is revealed, comprising two small problems that increase in difficulty as you advance through December. Solving each part of the problem correctly earns you one star. For those of you who love a competition, there are leaderboards, where earning the first star is worth 100 points, the second is 99, and so forth, down to 1 point for 100th place.</p>
<p>While KDB/Q may not always be the optimal programming language for solving all puzzles, it serves as an excellent platform to sharpen your KDB/Q skills and cultivate creative problem-solving abilities. It provides an opportunity to tackle challenges that might not be encountered in your daily work routine. If you ever get stuck in one of the problems or don't feel experienced enough, don't lose hope. There are plenty of developers who share their solutions on LinkedIn or <a href="https://community.kx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KX Community</a> and you can learn a lot by looking at their solutions.</p>
<p>Get your keyboards ready, Advent of Code starts tomorrow! Join the fun <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, you've delved into 'Q for Mortals' and a few other fundamental references I shared with you in my previous <a href="https://defconq.tech/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>, immersed yourself in code, tutorials, and successfully tackled your initial tasks. However, as you progress, you inevitably encounter that frustrating error. You try the different approaches you normally attempt when running into an error but you've exhausted every strategy, set breakpoints, meticulously stepped through the code, and yet, you can't figure out what's wrong with your code. Maybe you've encountered a challenge you are unsure how to tackle or perhaps you simply want to ensure your solution is optimal, whether in terms of execution time or memory usage. In any of these scenarios, the need for assistance arises, and in this blog post, we'll look at the different options for help with your KDB/Q challenges.</p>
<p>In the early days of KDB/Q (technically it was K back then but lets keep the history of KDB/Q for another blog post), comprehensive documentation and online resources were scarce. For those utilizing KDB/Q in a professional capacity, one option was to register with your work email address on a listbox/topicbox email distribution list. Here, you could post your questions or inquiries, relying on the hope that experienced and knowledgeable developers within the community would offer responses. Nevertheless, if you weren't using KDB/Q in a professional context or attempted to learn it independently, there were limited documentation and resources at your disposal.</p>
<p>Over time, the KDB/Q community expanded, leading to more comprehensive documentation and increased resources for seeking assistance. While KDB/Q doesn't enjoy the same level of all-pervasive online information as Python, where a simple Google search for 'How to do XYZ in Python' yields countless results, you can still depend on the two sources mentioned below to access support."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kx-community">KX Community<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Where%20to%20find%20help#kx-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to KX Community" title="Direct link to KX Community">​</a></h2>
<p>In September 2021, KX launched the KX Community, an online forum designed to serve as a centralized hub for all your KDB/Q inquiries. Within this forum, queries and issues are categorized into various discussion topics, including KDB/Q, KX Solutions or Products, KX Academy (which I previously discussed <a href="https://defconq.tech/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources#kx-academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), KX Insight, or their latest offering, KDB.AI.</p>
<p>The forum is open to anyone seeking answers related to KDB/Q, offering a user-friendly interface. It enjoys active participation from KDB/Q developers within the industry, and, notably, it is closely monitored by seasoned developers from KX. These KX experts serve as forum administrators and actively engage by responding to inquiries and questions.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the KX Community serves as an excellent resource for assistance when you encounter challenges. Additionally, it provides a valuable platform for acquiring knowledge about prevalent issues and their corresponding resolutions. Whether you're striving to comprehend the intricacies of KDB/Q, grappling with an architectural design query, or seeking insights into any of the KX products, this forum proves highly beneficial.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stackoverflow">Stackoverflow<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Where%20to%20find%20help#stackoverflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stackoverflow" title="Direct link to Stackoverflow">​</a></h2>
<p>If you're a developer, you're likely familiar with StackOverflow. However, for those who may not have encountered StackOverflow before, here's an analogy: StackOverflow is to programmers what Google is to non-programmers - an essential website for finding answers to all your questions.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, StackOverflow boasts a vast repository of 23,908,328 questions spanning the realms of programming, software development, and similar domains. Out of these 23 Million questions, a mere 2,269 questions are related to KDB/Q. Yes, you read that right, meaning that only <strong>0.0095%</strong> of all questions on Stackoverflow are related to KDB/Q. That's pretty low if you ask me. To provide a comparison, consider Python, one of the widely-used mainstream programming languages, which boasts a staggering 2.1 million questions, equivalent to approximately 9%.</p>
<p>The relatively limited number of KDB/Q questions on StackOverflow is combined with a lack of a robust categorization. While I consider StackOverflow a valuable platform for posting questions, I must also acknowledge that it may not offer the same level of structured organization as the KX Community.  However, it's worth mentioning that there is an active participation from experienced developers who consistently respond to KDB/Q queries, and I've personally come across valuable solutions and code snippets within the StackOverflow KDB/Q section as well.</p>
<p>I consider Stack Overflow to be a valuable supplement to your repertoire of resources for addressing KDB/Q-related queries.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Stackoverflow" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/Stackoverflow-ea88f4c118588bdb814af2c0b911414d.png" width="1446" height="1065" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mentorship">Mentorship<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Where%20to%20find%20help#mentorship" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mentorship" title="Direct link to Mentorship">​</a></h2>
<p>Another approach to seek solutions for your KDB/Q queries is to explore the possibility of finding a mentor. Whether you discover a mentor within your current team or organization, or seek one externally, I recommend initiating a mentor-mentee connection with an experienced KDB/Q developer. While some highly skilled KDB/Q developers may appear intimidating at first, you may be pleasantly surprised by the willingness of most of them to offer assistance and guidance.</p>
<p>To summarize, the combination of KX Community and StackOverflow, along with the option of connecting with a mentor or a knowledgeable colleague, provides a comprehensive support system to address any KDB/Q-related challenges you may encounter.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous blog post, I shared my favourite <a href="https://defconq.tech/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go-To KDB/Q Learning Resources</a> to help you to get started. However, as you dive deeper into the KDB/Q programming language and you begin to read and review other's code you might experience a slight sense of overwhelm. Two main characteristics of KDB/Q, namely its tersness and and its <a href="https://code.kx.com/q4m3/4_Operators/#412-left-of-right-evaluation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left-of-right</a> evaluation order (KDB/Q expressions are evaluated left-<strong>of</strong>-right which equates to expressions are evaluated right-<strong>to</strong>-left), can pose initial challenges for new KDB/Q developers. It's important to overcome these hurdles and become familiar with these features as you progress.</p>
<p>When you start looking at other's KDB/Q code for the first time, it can be akin to a five-year-old attempting to independently assemnle the gigantic Lego Millenium Falcon immediately after learning how to connect just two Lego pieces. The experience can be overwhelming, leaving you unsure where to start. THe image below serves as an illustration of the described sensation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Lego Millenium Falcon" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/lego_millenium_falcon-cdf46798eb4ee41eb41b725b9e689e5f.webp" width="1200" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When you assess your current knowledge in relation to the task at hand, you might perceive it as inadequate and insufficient.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if we deconstruct the code into smaller components and methodically examine it step by step, expression by expression, we often come to realize that the code we're grappling with may not always be as daunting as initially presumed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Lego Block" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/lego_block-10f57693d0c0e81bb8b38c8eb14a34b7.jpg" width="1594" height="1133" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>That's precisely the method we'll employ in this blog post. We'll dissect a line of KDB/Q code that could appear complex initially - maybe we won't even grasp its purpose at first glance. However, by breaking it down into small, discrete expressions and evaluating them sequentially, we'll unravel its underlying logic and functionality.</p>
<p>We are accomplishing this by examining a fascinating pattern introduced by Stephen Taylor, the KX Librarian, as outlined in this <a href="https://community.kx.com/t5/Community-Blogs/Meet-the-Zen-monks/ba-p/11604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>.

<p>The '?' operator, along with the '!' operator, arguably possesses the greatest number of overloads among KDB/Q operators. In this specific context, the '?' operator functions as a <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/ref/find/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>'find'</strong></a> operation.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example. Suppose we have a list of integers and we would like to find the index at which that element occurs. We can do this the following way:</p>

<p>The <code>'</code> operator exemplifies another unique concept within KDB/Q, which is the concept of <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/basics/iteration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iterators</a>. Iterators can be described as functions that take values as arguments and generate new functions that apply those values repetitively. In this specific instance, the <code>'</code> operator signifies <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/ref/maps/#each" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"each"</a> and applies a value item-by-item to a dictionary, list, or conforming combinations of lists and dictionaries.</p>
<p>Allow me to demonstrate this behavior with a straightforward example. Imagine we have a list of strings and aim to determine the length of each string:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)list:("Hello";"World";"lorem";"ipsum")</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)count list</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">4</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>count list</code> returns the length of the list of strings rather than the length of each individual string itself. We therefore have to use the <code>each</code> operator to achieve the desired result.</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)count each list</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">5 5 5 5</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>In the above example we make use of the mnemonic keyword <strong>each</strong> which can be used to apply a unary value without having to use parentheses or brackets. We could have achieved the same result by doing the following</p>

<p>When examining the entire code snippet together, we can see that <code>(expression)?'1b</code> will search (and find) the index of the first occurence of 1b in <strong>each</strong> element of the list denoted by expression.

<p>This expression can be further divided into three components.

<p>Let's examine each of these components separately, starting, in good KDB/Q fashion with the most right one:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)" "&lt;&gt;"Hello World"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">11111011111b</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The code we executed produces a boolean mask. It compares each element of the string to the empty string " " and yields "<strong>true</strong>" for elements that differ and "<strong>false</strong>" for those that are the same. Consequently, we can infer that the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> operator assesses inequality. If our aim is to do the opposite and examine equality, we can simply apply the equality operator, which is represented by <code>=</code>.</p>
<p>This conveys another, valuable lesson in KDB/Q, specifically: <em>"A fundamental feature of atomic functions is that their action extends automatically to the items in a list"</em> as explained in <a href="https://code.kx.com/q4m3/4_Operators/#403-extension-of-atomic-functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 4: Operators</a> of "Q for Mortals".</p>

<p>Prior to delving into the <code>1 function\input</code> pattern, let's explore the functionality of the keyword <code>reverse</code>.</p>
<p>As you probably can guess, the keyword <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/ref/reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>reverse</code></a> reverses the order of items of a list or dictionary.</p>

<p>Now, it's time to address the most intricate part of this code snippet - the <code>1 function\input</code> pattern. The <code>\</code> operator is referred to as "Scan". To clarify the "Scan" iterator, we must first explain the "Over" iterator. <em>"The <a href="https://code.kx.com/q4m3/6_Functions/#676-over-for-accumulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over</a> iterator <code>/</code> is a higher-order function that provides the principal mechanism for recursion in q. In its simplest form it modifies a binary function to accumulate results over a list"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"The <a href="https://code.kx.com/q4m3/6_Functions/#678-scan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scan</a> iterator <code>\</code> is a higher-order function that behaves just like <code>/</code> except that it returns all the intermediate accumulations instead of just the final one".</em></p>
<p>Now let's illustrate this with an example, a single line of code carries the weight of a thousand words.</p>
<p>First, let's look at <code>Over</code></p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)(+/)1 2 3 4 5</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">15</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Can you perceive what "Over" does? It applies the binary function <code>+</code> to the list <code>1 2 3 4 5</code> and accumulates the results over the list, effectively returning the sum of all elements <code>1 2 3 4 5</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at <code>Scan</code></p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)(+\)1 2 3 4 5</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">1 3 6 10 15</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Much like Over, Scan also yields the cumulative sum of all elements in the list, however, with one key difference: Scan returns all intermediate steps, returning the rolling sum, rather than just the sum of all elements.</p>

<p>Because of KDB/Q's concise nature, operators have numerous overloads. This principle extends to the iterators Over and Scan. Depending on the valence (the number of inputs to a function) associated with Over or Scan, these iterators exhibit varying behavior. A comprehensive list of their behaviors can be found <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/ref/iterators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>In the context of the <code>1 function\input</code> pattern, Scan functions similarly to what you might recognize as a "Do-Loop" in conventional programming languages. It's important to note that Scan will also produce the input as the initial result when applied to a unary function.</p>
<p>The following example should illustrate this behavior:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)5 enlist\1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">,1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">,,1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">,,,1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">,,,,1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">,,,,,1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)5(`f;)\1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(`f;1)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(`f;(`f;1))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(`f;(`f;(`f;1)))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(`f;(`f;(`f;(`f;1))))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(`f;(`f;(`f;(`f;(`f;1)))))</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>In the initial example, you'll observe that the number 1 is enlisted five times, whereas in the second example, a nested list is generated with a depth of five levels. Both examples begin by displaying the input as the initial step.</p>
<p>Now, let's try to put things together and see what we get. Let's look at the following code snippet:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">q)1 reverse\"Hello"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">"Hello"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">"olleH"</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>As we explained earlier, the Scan will display the input first, and then repeat the function, reverse in this case, n-times, where n is 1, resulting into a list of strings consisting of "Hello" the original string, and its reverse "olleH"</p>
<p>Let's attempt to apply this concept to the originally provided string:  "     Trim spaces     ", and apply the whole expression within parentheses</p>

<p>The initial segment of the expression involves a character-by-character comparison between the given input string and an empty string. It yields a boolean mask with <code>0b</code> where the elements differ and <code>1b</code> where they match. This boolean mask is subsequently utilized as input for the <code>1 function\pattern.</code> In this context, Scan begins by presenting the input, followed by applying the <code>reverse</code> function precisely once.</p>
<p>Let's combine that with the initial expression we examined, <code>?'1b</code> find each 1b:</p>

<p>Now, the remaining task is to integrate our understanding of "drop" with our knowledge of "Over." In this scenario, "Over" is applied to a binary function where "drop" takes two parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y.</code> Upon closer examination of the code, it's apparent that within the lambda, we apply <code>y _ x</code> rather than <code>x _ y.</code> However, you might be wondering about the additional <code>x</code> preceding the lambda. This variation arises from the different notation forms offered in KDB/Q. Functions can be expressed in either prefix or infix notation.</p>
<p>Application of a binary function <code>f</code> on arguments <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is written <code>f[x;y]</code> in <strong>prefix</strong> or <code>x f y</code> in <strong>infix</strong>. Note: <strong>infix</strong> notation only works for Q functions, while functions defined by yourself can only be used in <strong>prefix</strong> notation.</p>
<p>You can find the different applications of iterators and their valence <a href="https://code.kx.com/q/ref/accumulators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>Over applied to a binary function can be written either</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">x v2/y</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">or</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">v2/[x;y]</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>meaning that the <code>x</code> we observe in front of the lambda function <code>{y _ x}/</code> is the first parameter to the function.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Read,%20Understand%20and%20Learn%20KDB/Q%20code#putting-it-all-together" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Putting it all together" title="Direct link to Putting it all together">​</a></h2>
<p>If we take a closer look at the entire code, we'll notice that the input to the primary lambda function is the string we intend to trim. Additionally, the <code>y</code> parameter in the lambda corresponds to the two indexes, 3 and -2. If you recall from the initial part of the code, when we reverse the boolean mask, we obtain the first index of a "true" flag in the "original" boolean mask and the first index of a "true' flag in the "reversed" boolean mask. However, let's pause for a moment and consider this. The first index of a "true" flag in the "reversed" boolean mask is, in fact, the same as the first index of the "original" boolean mask when we count from the opposite end of the boolean mask (namely from the back/end).</p>
<p>Haven't we recently discovered that "drop" used in conjunction with a negative number will discard the last "n" elements? Indeed, we have! So, the remaining piece of the puzzle is to grasp how "Over" is applied to this function. Yet, we're already acquainted with this concept, as "Over" serves as a higher-order function that facilitates recursion in q. In its basic form, it adapts a binary function to accumulate results over a list.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek. To simplify matters, I'll display some of the intermediate outcomes rather than the entire expression

<p>If you're new to the Q programming language and embarking on your learning journey, your first step should be to thoroughly read "Q for Mortals" by Jeffry A. Borror, cover to cover. This book serves as a comprehensive guide to essential q concepts and provides a strong foundation in understanding the KDB/Q database.</p>
<p>Beginning with the fundamental data structures of KDB/Q, including Atoms, Lists, and Dictionaries, the book progressively introduces you to Tables, which form a core data structure in KDB/Q. It delves into intricate details about the functioning of operators, guides you through crafting your custom functions, an integral aspect of functional programming (though KDB/Q isn't purely functional), and illustrates the creation of derived functions using iterators, another pivotal element of KDB/Q.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 introduces q-sql and its role in querying and manipulating tables, while Chapter 14 offers insights into the KDB/Q database, encompassing the process of persisting data to disk. These chapters collectively provide an excellent foundational understanding of KDB/Q, making "Q for Mortals" an indispensable resource for newcomers as well as experienced developers.</p>
<p>Written in a highly accessible manner, the book is accompanied by illustrative coding examples and snippets, allowing for easy comprehension and hands-on learning. After completing a full read-through, you can revisit specific chapters whenever needed to reinforce your understanding and delve deeper into the content for a more solid grasp.</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-tips-by-nick-psaris">Q-Tips by Nick Psaris<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources#q-tips-by-nick-psaris" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Q-Tips by Nick Psaris" title="Direct link to Q-Tips by Nick Psaris">​</a></h4>
<p>After reading of "Q for Mortals," the next step is to explore my preferred KDB/Q book, "Q Tips," authored by Nick Psaris. While "Q Tips" does offer an initial section introducing fundamental concepts and KDB/Q data structures in its initial chapters, I personally found it more advantageous to have a foundational understanding from "Q for Mortals" before delving into "Q Tips."</p>
<p>Within the pages of this book, Nick draws upon his extensive experience and insights garnered from hands-on usage of KDB/Q within a dynamic real-world trading setting. He leads readers on a practical expedition, guiding them through the step-by-step construction of an intricate event processor in KDB/Q, right from the ground up. Nick seamlessly intertwines the fundamental elements of KDB/Q with the pertinent intricacies of market microstructure, resulting in the creation of a synthetic market data generator.</p>
<p>In this context, Nick not only illustrates how to efficiently capture, store, and analyze vast datasets, but also explains the Q programming paradigm and progressively develops the associated libraries. Throughout this journey, he weaves in well-observed and refined tips that he's gleaned from his own experience, ensuring readers gain comprehensive insights into the process.</p>
<p>As you can see from the image of my well-worn copy of Q-Tips below I have read the book several times from front to back and I wholeheartedly recommend Q-Tips to anyone who wants to bring their KDB/Q programming skills to the next level.</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kx-academy">KX Academy<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources#kx-academy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to KX Academy" title="Direct link to KX Academy">​</a></h4>
<p>In October 2021 KX announced the launch of <a href="https://kx.com/academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KX Academy</a>, an online portal for on-demand training. The Academy offers a range of courses, split into two main difficulty levels, Fundamentals and Advanced. In addition to that, you can also find introductory sessions on KX Dashboard, KX Developer, KX Insight and the recently published Python Interface, PyKX. Demos and Tutorials will deepen your newly acquired knowledge with some practical, hands-on examples.</p>
<p>The Fundamental section combines a series of 15 short courses containing expanatory videos and Jupiter notebooks running in a freely accessible, live sandbox development environment with pre-loaded data sets, giving you seemingless access to the power of KDB/Q without having to install anything on your local machine. This is a perfect, practical addition to the book "Q for Mortals" mentioned earlier. I suggest you take the courses alongside when reading the book.</p>
<p>The Advanced section of KX Academy builds up on your previously acquired knowledge and explains more advanced concepts of KDB/Q in 15 Jupiter notebook courses. The modules cover topics such as Enumeration, Attributes, different ways of persisting tables, Joins, Iterators, Functional Selects and more. These topics are also covered in "Q for Mortals" but again, the Jupiter notebooks provide a great practical addition to the theory covered in great detail in the book.</p>
<p>After completing each section, you have the opportunity to validate your understanding by obtaining either of the two certificates, putting your knowledge to test.</p>
