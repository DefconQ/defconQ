        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday (2025.12.16) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/nasdaq-seeks-extend-trading-hours-wall-street-gears-up-247-move-2025-12-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nasdaq announced an extension of its trading hours</strong></a>, a move that once again reshapes how modern markets operate. While headlines focus on increased accessibility and global participation, the real impact is felt much deeper in the technology stacks that power trading, analytics, and risk systems.
Extending trading hours is <em><strong>not</strong></em> just a business or regulatory change. It’s a <strong>data engineering problem.</strong> And a non-trivial one.
In this post, I want to unpack what extended trading hours actually mean from a <strong>technical perspective</strong>, why many traditional data architectures will struggle, and why systems built with <strong>KDB/Q</strong> (or KDB-X) are particularly well suited to absorb this change without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Nasdaq extends trading hours" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/nasdaq-e18f8c5568530d1ffda1d9defb416190.jpg" width="720" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-changed-more-time-more-data-same-expectations">What Changed: More Time, More Data, Same Expectations<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#what-changed-more-time-more-data-same-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Changed: More Time, More Data, Same Expectations" title="Direct link to What Changed: More Time, More Data, Same Expectations">​</a></h2>
<p>Historically, markets had well-defined trading sessions. Systems were designed around them:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear <strong>start of day</strong></li>
<li>A clear <strong>end of day</strong></li>
<li>Overnight batch processes</li>
<li>Predictable data volumes</li>
<li>Fixed intraday windows for analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Extended trading hours fundamentally challenge these assumptions. From a systems perspective, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longer continuous data streams</strong></li>
<li><strong>Higher total daily data volume</strong></li>
<li><strong>More intraday state to manage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fewer clean reset points</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased overlap across regions and venues</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And crucially:
<strong>Latency, throughput, and availability expectations do not relax just because the day is longer.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-hidden-cost-volume-isnt-linear">The Hidden Cost: Volume Isn’t Linear<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#the-hidden-cost-volume-isnt-linear" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Hidden Cost: Volume Isn’t Linear" title="Direct link to The Hidden Cost: Volume Isn’t Linear">​</a></h2>
<p>A common mistake is to assume that extending trading hours simply increases volume <em><strong>linearly</strong></em>. In practice, it often doesn’t. Extended hours introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher <strong>market fragmentation</strong></li>
<li>More <strong>algorithmic and automated participation</strong></li>
<li>Increased <strong>event-driven bursts</strong> (news, macro, cross-venue reactions)</li>
<li>Longer periods where <strong>real-time analytics</strong> must stay hot</li>
</ul>
<p>That means <strong>more ticks, more state, more joins, more aggregations, and more pressure on memory and compute</strong>.</p>
<p>Systems that were “just about fast enough” during regular hours may suddenly fall over.</p>

<p>Most modern data stacks weren’t designed for <em><strong>continuous, high-frequency, time-series workloads.</strong></em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-row-based-storage">1. Row Based Storage<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#1-row-based-storage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.

<p>Row-oriented systems are <strong>inefficient</strong> when queries scan time ranges <strong>across a small number of columns</strong>, which is exactly what market data workloads do.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-disk-first-architectures">2. Disk-First Architectures<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#2-disk-first-architectures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Disk-First Architectures" title="Direct link to 2. Disk-First Architectures">​</a></h3>
<p>Systems that rely heavily on disk I/O, even with caching, struggle when <strong>real-time queries and ingestion</strong> happen simultaneously over extended periods.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-complex-streaming-pipelines">3. Complex Streaming Pipelines<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#3-complex-streaming-pipelines" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.

<p>Many stacks glue together:</p>
<ul>
<li>A streaming layer</li>
<li>A storage layer</li>
<li>A compute layer</li>
<li>A query layer</li>
</ul>
<p>Each boundary adds latency, failure modes, and operational complexity.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-overnight-assumptions">4. Overnight Assumptions<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#4-overnight-assumptions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Overnight Assumptions" title="Direct link to 4. Overnight Assumptions">​</a></h3>
<p>Batch jobs, rollovers, save-downs, and re-indexing jobs often assume a quiet overnight window. Extended trading hours shrink, or eliminate, that window entirely.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-kdb-handles-this-naturally">Why KDB Handles This Naturally<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#why-kdb-handles-this-naturally" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why KDB Handles This Naturally" title="Direct link to Why KDB Handles This Naturally">​</a></h2>
<p>This is where <strong>KDB/Q stands apart</strong>, not because it’s <em><strong>“fast”</strong></em>, but because of how it’s designed.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-built-for-continuous-time-series">1. Built for Continuous Time-Series<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#1-built-for-continuous-time-series" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Built for Continuous Time-Series" title="Direct link to 1. Built for Continuous Time-Series">​</a></h3>
<p>KDB/Q is not a database that supports time-series. It is a time-series system by design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is stored in vectors/arrays</li>
<li>Time is a first-class concept</li>
<li>Vector operations are second nature</li>
<li>Queries scale with time ranges, not table size</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer trading hours <em>simply mean more rows</em>. The access pattern doesn’t change.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-in-memory-first-disk-as-an-optimization">2. In-Memory First, Disk as an Optimization<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#2-in-memory-first-disk-as-an-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. In-Memory First, Disk as an Optimization" title="Direct link to 2. In-Memory First, Disk as an Optimization">​</a></h3>
<p>KDB/Q’s architecture cleanly separates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time data (RDB), in memory</li>
<li>Historical data (HDB), memory-mapped on disk</li>
</ul>
<p>Extended trading hours don’t require redesigning the system. They just change <strong>how long the RDB stays hot and how often data is persisted.</strong></p>
<p>Memory-mapped storage ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>No deserialization overhead</li>
<li>No ORM layers</li>
<li>No impedance mismatch between memory and disk</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-streaming-is-native-not-bolted-on">3. Streaming Is Native, Not Bolted On<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#3-streaming-is-native-not-bolted-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Streaming Is Native, Not Bolted On" title="Direct link to 3. Streaming Is Native, Not Bolted On">​</a></h3>
<p>In KDB/Q, streaming isn’t an add-on, it’s the default.</p>
<ul>
<li>IPC is lightweight and event-driven</li>
<li>Subscribers process updates as they arrive</li>
<li>Backpressure patterns (e.g. chained tickerplants) are well understood</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the market trades for 6 hours or 20 hours is largely irrelevant. The system is already designed to run (almost) continuously.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-analytics-live-where-the-data-lives">4. Analytics Live Where the Data Lives<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#4-analytics-live-where-the-data-lives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Analytics Live Where the Data Lives" title="Direct link to 4. Analytics Live Where the Data Lives">​</a></h3>
<p>This becomes even <em>more important</em> with longer trading days. Instead of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pull all the data out, then analyze it somewhere else”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KDB/Q allows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Run the analytics where the data already is”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller result sets over the network</li>
<li>Lower bandwidth pressure</li>
<li>Faster response times</li>
<li>More predictable performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Extended trading hours amplify the cost of moving data. KDB avoids that cost entirely.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operational-reality-fewer-moving-parts-win">Operational Reality: Fewer Moving Parts Win<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Nasdaq%20Extends%20Trading%20Hours%20-%20What%20It%20Really%20Means%20for%20Market%20Data%20Systems#operational-reality-fewer-moving-parts-win" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operational Reality: Fewer Moving Parts Win" title="Direct link to Operational Reality: Fewer Moving Parts Win">​</a></h2>
<p>When markets run longer, <strong>operational simplicity matters more than ever.</strong> KDB/Q based systems typically replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming frameworks</li>
<li>Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) engines</li>
<li>Time-series databases</li>
<li>Analytics runtimes</li>
</ul>
<p>... with <strong>ONE COHERENT SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p>That matters when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring windows are longer</li>
<li>Failure recovery must be faster</li>
<li>Engineers are on-call for extended periods</li>
<li>Systems must degrade gracefully, not catastrophically</li>
</ul>

<p>Nasdaq extending trading hours isn’t an isolated event. Already towards the end of last year, we saw the New York Stock Exchange extend its trading hours (Read my blog post <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/NYSE%20extends%20trading%20hours" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Most cryptocurrency exchanges already operate 24/7, and it’s clear that more traditional exchanges will follow this trend. We’re seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>More global overlap</li>
<li>More electronic liquidity</li>
<li>More automation</li>
<li>More demand for always-on systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Markets are moving closer to continuous operation. Architectures that depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quiet periods</li>
<li>Batch windows</li>
<li>Heavy ETL</li>
<li>Complex pipelines
... will increasingly struggle to keep up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Extended trading hours are a <strong>stress test</strong> for market data architectures. They expose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden assumptions</li>
<li>Scalability limits</li>
<li>Operational fragility</li>
</ul>
<p>Systems built with <strong>KDB/Q</strong> (KDB-X) don’t need to be reinvented for this shift. They were already designed for it. If anything, changes like this highlight <em><strong>why</strong></em> KDB/Q has remained dominant in high-performance market data systems for decades, not because it’s fashionable, but because it solves the right problems at the right level of abstraction. And as markets keep pushing toward longer, faster, and more continuous trading, those design choices matter more than ever.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week marked one of my professional highlights of the year, the long-awaited <a href="https://www.alphaevents.com/events-quantstratsuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quant Strats</a> conference finally took place! Hosted on October 14–15 at Convene 22 Bishopsgate in London, the event delivered two action-packed days filled with cutting-edge insights, technical deep dives, and forward-thinking discussions at the intersection of quantitative finance, AI, and data infrastructure.
Just like last year, this blog post will recap the event and share some of the key highlights. Among them was undoubtedly my KDB/Q Masterclass, a deep dive into <strong>Wall Street’s most powerful array programming language and real-time database</strong>. Keep reading to find out more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alexander Unterrainer of DefconQ at Quant Strats Europe 2025 giving a Masterclass on KDB/Q" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/QuantStratsMasterclass-8930eaea7c24d498d8aa5aec06555080.jpeg" width="2048" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.alphaevents.com/events-quantstratsuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quant Strats</a> took place right in the heart of the City of London, the historical financial district, just a short walk from Bank Station. As you stroll down Threadneedle Street, passing the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bank of England</strong></a> on your left and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Exchange,_London" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Royal Exchange</strong></a>, one of the world’s oldest trading hubs, first opened in 1571, you can almost feel the spirit of global finance in the air. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Voltaire</strong></a> captured this essence perfectly in <strong>Letters on the English (1733)</strong>, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take a view of the Royal Exchange in London, a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan, and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fitting reflection on the city that still serves as one of the world’s great crossroads of commerce and ideas.</p>

<p>But on this particular Tuesday morning, the usual buzz of the City of London was matched, no surpassed, by the energy inside the halls of <strong>Quant Strats Europe 2025</strong>. With over <strong>500 attendees</strong> representing some of the world’s leading buy- and sell-side institutions, the atmosphere was electric, a room full of some of the brightest minds in quantitative finance, all eager to connect, learn, and push the boundaries of the field.</p>

<li><strong>Expo demo drives and networking breaks</strong> built in to let practitioners explore tools and connect</li>
<li><strong>An app that truly elevates the conference experience</strong>: Guiding you seamlessly through the event with a host of powerful features. I already raved about the Quant Strats Event App last year (you can read my full review <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/DefconQ%20goes%20QuantStrats%202024#organisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), and it continues to impress.</li>
<li>A spotlight on data infrastructure, deployment architecture, and real-time systems rather than just pure model research</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the <em><strong>focus shifted from signal generation to signal execution, model robustness, deployment trade-offs, and system architecture</strong></em>, exactly where the rubber meets the road in quant finance.</p>

<p>For me, the highlight of Quant Strats was leading the <strong>90-minute masterclass</strong> titled <em><strong>Data to Deployment: End-to-End Coding for Quant Analysts</strong></em>. In that session, I guided attendees through a full pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction to KDB/Q</strong>: History, evolution and important concepts of Wall Street's most powerful array programming language</li>
<li><strong>Ingest &amp; Stream Data</strong> - live integration from historical end-of-day (EOD) files as well as real time data from <a href="https://databento.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Databento</strong></a>, a market data provider, giving you <strong>125$</strong> credit when signing up.</li>
<li><strong>Data Handling &amp; Cleaning</strong> - parsing, transformations, and schema logic</li>
<li><strong>Signal Generation &amp; Strategy Logic</strong> - crafting a simple rading signal, using simple moving averages (SMA), in KDB/Q</li>
<li><strong>Optimization, Deployment &amp; Execution</strong> - from prototype to a deployable system</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging existing libraries</strong> such as <a href="https://exequtionanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ExeQution Analytics</strong></a>, to focus on what's important: <strong>turning data into alpha</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visualization &amp; Dashboarding</strong> - showing results using <a href="https://www.timestored.com/pulse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pulse</strong></a>, the framework that even makes me enjoy UI work</li>
</ol>
<p>What made the Masterclass special is the balance between hands-on coding and strategic architecture. Many participants told me afterward that seeing <em><strong>how everything connected:</strong></em> <strong>data ➡️  model ➡️  execution ➡️  monitoring</strong>, helped solidify how to build a real quant system, not just isolated research code.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alexander Unterrainer from DefconQ KDB/Q Masterclass" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/QuantStratsMasterclass2-ee480054db8989ccd81b8cd92e579479.jpeg" width="1600" height="1067" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>One recurring theme during the masterclass (and across the event) was the significance of performance, interpretability, and model flexibility. Building for speed is important, but so is building for maintainability and resilience over time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="memorable-panels--moments">Memorable Panels &amp; Moments<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Quant%20Strats%20Europe%202025%20-%20Event%20Recap%20&amp;%20Highlights#memorable-panels--moments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Memorable Panels &amp; Moments" title="Direct link to Memorable Panels &amp; Moments">​</a></h2>
<p>Some highlights that stuck with me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Geopolitical Shock Panel</strong> asked: <em>How do you separate noise vs signal in global events? and What data sets help decode policy shocks in real time?</em> It’s a reminder that markets don’t operate in a vacuum and quant models must ingest events.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Warfare: Winning the AI Arms Race</strong> explored where quant teams get edge when everyone has access to advanced models and compute. Not just model selection, but infrastructure, data, pipelines, and latency matter.</li>
<li><strong>Model interpretability &amp; explainable AI</strong> sessions tackled guardrails: how to deploy ML in finance when regulators or stakeholders demand transparency.</li>
<li>The discussion on <strong>where models should live</strong>, cloud vs on-prem, tackled real tradeoffs: latency, compliance, cost, and hybrid flexibility.</li>
<li>And the closing keynote <em><strong>From Pit Wall to Portfolio</strong></em>, by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-random-logic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Martin</a> (ex-Formula 1 strategist) drew powerful parallels between motorsport analytics and quant finance: split-second decisions, feedback loops, and optimizing under pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reflections--takeaways">Reflections &amp; Takeaways<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Quant%20Strats%20Europe%202025%20-%20Event%20Recap%20&amp;%20Highlights#reflections--takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reflections &amp; Takeaways" title="Direct link to Reflections &amp; Takeaways">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systems matter as much as models</strong>: Many talks framed quant work not just as statistical or ML problems, but as engineering and software problems.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment &amp; infrastructure tradeoffs shine</strong>: It’s one thing to produce a signal in Jupyter or research code; it’s another to embed it into a production pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Data quality, latency &amp; pipeline robustness are differentiators</strong>: Several speakers emphasized that alpha can be lost more in poor data ingestion or messy pipelines than in suboptimal modeling.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid architectures are the future</strong>: The middle ground, balancing on-prem control with cloud scalability, is where many quant firms will land.</li>
<li><strong>AI &amp; LLMs are maturing but need guardrails</strong>: The promise is high, but interpretability, drift, and risk control cannot be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Quant%20Strats%20Europe%202025%20-%20Event%20Recap%20&amp;%20Highlights#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>From a personal perspective, seeing the breadth of talent in one room, researchers, engineers, portfolio experts, platform builders, reaffirms that the future of quant is multidisciplinary. Model authors must understand pipelines; engineers must think in signal space. And <strong>KDB/Q continues to prove why it’s the gold standard for quantitative finance</strong>. Its unmatched ability to process, analyse, and store massive volumes of real-time and historical data makes it the ultimate choice for building modern, scalable, and ultra-low-latency systems. Whether you’re streaming tick data, engineering features for machine learning, or running complex backtests, KDB/Q empowers quants to focus on insights rather than infrastructure. Simply put, when it comes to speed, scalability, and precision, nothing comes close.</p>
<p>I walked away energized, with new connections, fresh ideas, and a clearer view of where quant finance is heading.</p>
<p>If you’re working with KDB/Q, or planning to, and need expert guidance on architecture reviews, system design, or simply want to deepen your understanding of the language, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m always happy to help fellow quants and developers get the most out of KDB/Q and bring their data infrastructure to the next level.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="belfast-happy-hour-a-small-city-with-a-big-kdbq-community">Belfast Happy Hour: A Small City with a Big KDB/Q Community<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/From%20Belfast%20to%20New%20York,%20Two%20Happy%20Hours%20and%20a%20Conference#belfast-happy-hour-a-small-city-with-a-big-kdbq-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Belfast Happy Hour: A Small City with a Big KDB/Q Community" title="Direct link to Belfast Happy Hour: A Small City with a Big KDB/Q Community">​</a></h2>
<p>It’s hardly a surprise that plenty of KDB/Q developers come from Ireland, after all, both of the leading KDB/Q consultancies, <strong>Data Intellect</strong> and <strong>First Derivatives</strong>, are based there. And just as much as Belfast baps and unpredictable weather are part of Irish life, neither rain nor wind could keep the local KDB/Q community from gathering for the <a href="https://kx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KX</strong></a> &amp; <strong>DefconQ Brews and Q’s Happy Hour</strong>, the first community meetup in quite some time.</p>
<p>Thanks to our generous sponsor <a href="https://kx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KX</strong></a>, the drinks were flowing, and around <strong>50 developers</strong> came together for an evening of reconnecting with old friends, meeting new peers, and enjoying the community vibe without a fixed agenda. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and there’s already demand for the next Belfast Happy Hour!</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse of the Happy Hour in pictures</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the saying that New York is the city that never sleeps, and my week there proved it true. Between battling jetlag, working with my client (a major hedge fund), joining a Data Intellect dinner with colleagues in town, hosting the DefconQ New York Happy Hour, and speaking on a panel at the Cornell Future of Finance &amp; AI Conference, there was hardly any time left for sightseeing. I also took the chance to meet one of my role models, Nick Psaris, author of my all-time favourite KDB/Q book Q-Tips.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bridging-time-zones-working-for-a-global-team">Bridging Time Zones: Working for a Global Team<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/From%20Belfast%20to%20New%20York,%20Two%20Happy%20Hours%20and%20a%20Conference#bridging-time-zones-working-for-a-global-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bridging Time Zones: Working for a Global Team" title="Direct link to Bridging Time Zones: Working for a Global Team">​</a></h3>
<p>Working for an international investment bank or hedge fund usually means being part of a global team spread across multiple time zones. The same is true for the hedge fund I work with, our team spans three different regions. Since I was already planning a trip to New York to speak at a conference, I took the opportunity to spend a few days working from the New York office. Meeting my colleagues face-to-face was a refreshing change from our usual messenger chats and video calls, and it was great to connect with everyone in person.</p>

<p>As I wasn’t the only Data Intellect team member in town, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyce-tiu-4762086/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Joyce</strong></a>, our <strong>Head of North America</strong>, took the opportunity to bring together all New York based colleagues for a dinner. It was a great chance to meet many new faces and connect with some of the developers I’d previously interacted with.</p>

<p>Since this was my first visit to New York, I couldn’t resist following a personal agenda and meeting some people I’ve always wanted to connect with.</p>
<p>First up was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpsaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Psaris</a>, one of my role models and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tips-Fast-Scalable-Maintainable-Kdb/dp/9881389909?crid=G2TNX4GGQWIG&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.VCKeLo2g0L8BbcEPt_fQmAIJX9-x_c0VvRd85jm-W1GZeeW3sYheJeXYEmGb_uzVQ96Szn9Y33CyZ7thZJhEkhZ81vgmveNSIGlKgQlrRIrR90WjnKnHx1AXQsrI7fClQt2Ut8K07NJc1P0z4N7o0YTFsmBXfmDZ8687ewEYMHYChLIjm7DHEWn05iRHNUXiD9pZFf973sTZPEy9lkPVfjzedZz599oQiczct4Z3u7JPqXmVunDckZL5VDu2SRbg7mLW4KHnKqta1G_zwbftP3SzCs8mxY2X4ISEirUU12w.sFEP6CnW5pGkCGk53MFSKyczImItuxsp4epLvtG5Ag0&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=kDB&amp;nsdOptOutParam=true&amp;qid=1729545712&amp;sprefix=kdb,aps,86&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=defconq-21&amp;linkId=ff9bc9c3ae8e15e4dc6e0b6fabf6d95a&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Q-Tips: Fast, Scalable and Maintainable KDB</strong></em></a>, my all-time favorite KDB/Q book. We caught up on a sunny day in Bryant Park, right in the heart of Manhattan, and had a fascinating conversation about all things KDB/Q. It was a real highlight for me, and I even got my copy of <strong>Q-Tips</strong> signed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Nick Psaris and Alexander Unterrainer in Byrant Park New York" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/NickPsaris-2d55372d49ed12aeec576f422b93735f.jpg" width="2880" height="3840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Next, I had the pleasure of meeting <strong>Dennis Shasha</strong>, professor and computer science researcher. Dennis was one of the earliest users of KDB/Q, and it was inspiring to hear his stories about the early days of Q and K. To my surprise, I also discovered that Dennis isn’t just a polyglot in programming languages, he’s fluent in German, Italian, French, and Spanish. We also bonded over our shared connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>South Tyrol</strong></a>, my hometown, where Dennis gives guest lectures at the <a href="https://www.unibz.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Free University of Bolzano</strong></a>, the very place I earned my bachelor’s degree.</p>

<p>And finally, I met the legendary inventor of KDB/Q himself, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurwhitney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Arthur Whitney</strong></a>. I’ll admit, I was pretty nervous heading into dinner at a small American restaurant, after all, I wanted to make a good impression. But Arthur was incredibly welcoming and generous with his wisdom. Of course, we talked plenty about KDB/Q, but we also shared thoughts beyond tech. The evening flew by, and I left feeling deeply grateful for the experience.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September 17th, right across from Grand Central Station, the New York KDB/Q community came together for the very first, and definitely not the last, <strong>DefconQ Happy Hour</strong>, generously sponsored by <a href="https://dataintellect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Data Intellect</strong></a>. Around 50 KDB/Q developers and enthusiasts gathered in one of Manhattan’s lively pubs to connect, share ideas, network, and simply enjoy a great evening together.</p>
<p><strong>Data Intellect</strong> was out in full force, with many of their New York-based developers joining, alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyce-tiu-4762086/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Joyce</strong></a>, Head of North America, and special guests <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciara-mccloskey-88b1b2177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ciara</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-wright-aquaq-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Paul</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-gilmore-881908125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justin</strong></a> who flew in from London.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was buzzing, the conversations flowed as easily as the drinks, and true to tradition, a few of us stayed until closing time.</p>

The discussion was moderated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonritter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gordon Ritter</a> and featured an impressive lineup including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioana-boier-9083a998/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlNQ%2BI2JuSKuOtHQV9rMcHg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Ioana Boier</a> (AI Research, Nvidia), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanreich/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlNQ%2BI2JuSKuOtHQV9rMcHg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evan Reich</a> (Head of Data Strategy &amp; Sourcing, Verition Fund Management LLC ), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulmkrueger/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlNQ%2BI2JuSKuOtHQV9rMcHg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Krueger</a> (Quant Trader, Millennium), and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganslade/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlNQ%2BI2JuSKuOtHQV9rMcHg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John "Morgan" Slade</a> (CEO, Exponential Technology Inc.) and myself.</p>
<p>Organized by Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-averbukh-kulikov-05aa403/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Averbukh</a> (Director, Cornell Financial Engineering Manhattan) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-fleiss-70b49410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander Fleiss</a> (CEO, Rebellion Research), the conference has become a staple in the finance community. This year was no exception: sold out with over <strong>300 attendees</strong>, yet still intimate enough to connect, exchange ideas, and strengthen industry relationships.</p>
<p>I was also happy to reconnect with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaqi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina Qi</a>, CEO of <a href="https://databento.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databento</a>, who I first met in London earlier this year. Her company is making big waves on Wall Street with its fresh approach to market data.

<p>Overall, I truly enjoyed contributing to such a high-caliber event and look forward to hopefully taking the stage again in the future.</p>

<p>Looking back, I can honestly say that this past week in New York has been one of the proudest moments of my career so far. From sitting in front of a Bloomberg Terminal for the very first time at 19, fresh out of high school with no clear direction, to experiencing the 2008 financial crisis while working in the portfolio management team of a small investment bank in Northern Italy, to returning to university at 23 and eventually rejoining the workforce at 28 in a large international investment bank in London… I never would have imagined that one day I would be working on Wall Street, even if only for a week, halfway across the globe. Here’s to many more adventures ahead.</p>

<p>What began as a small personal hobby, mainly to improve my own KDB/Q skills, has since evolved into a full-fledged side project and growing community. I never expected the blog to gain such traction, nor could I have imagined the incredible feedback and connections it would bring.</p>
<p>I’m truly grateful to everyone who has supported DefconQ along the way, whether you’ve subscribed to the newsletter, liked or reshared a LinkedIn post, attended a community meet-up, or simply read an article. Your encouragement and engagement mean the world to me.</p>
<p>As is now tradition, I’d love to share some of the highlights from the past year. Let’s take a look back and celebrate what we’ve built together. And if you’re wondering who won the <strong>FREE PREMIUM ticket</strong> to <a href="https://www.alphaevents.com/events-quantstratsuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Quant Strats Europe 2025</strong></a>, where I’ll be hosting a KDB/Q Masterclass, keep reading.

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blog-posts">Blog Posts<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Two%20Years%20of%20DefconQ%20-%20From%20Baby%20Steps%20to%20Big%20Leaps#blog-posts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blog Posts" title="Direct link to Blog Posts">​</a></h3>
<p>Just like last year, I want to start my recap with the metric that makes me proudest: the number of blog posts published. At its heart, DefconQ has always been about sharing knowledge and helping others learn KDB/Q. Over the past <strong>12 months</strong>, I published <strong>31 blog posts</strong>, a steady increase from the <strong>26 articles in year one</strong>. From deep dives into key KDB/Q concepts and hands-on tutorials, to curated resources, podcasts, community meet-ups, industry insights and news, the range of content has been both fun and rewarding to create. On average, this equates to one post every two weeks, a rhythm that shows consistency, but also reflects sustainable growth. Thank you to everyone who has read, shared, or joined along the way. Below are some highlights of the traffic and reach DefconQ achieved this year!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Blog Page Views 2025" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/pageViews-8cc8d32ce41eda9d0c16eba3003bbe32.png" width="1528" height="599" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>While DefconQ typically sees a steady flow of a few hundred visitors per day, the chart shows two significant spikes toward the end. Both are easy to trace back: the first coincides with my blog post on KDB-X, the newly launched KDB/Q community edition, while the second follows shortly after my third appearance on the ArrayCast as a guest panelist. The first spike from my blog post on KDB-X (link <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/From%20Elite%20to%20Everyone%20-%20KX%20Community%20Edition%20Breaks%20Loose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), drew nearly <strong>2000 views</strong> on its own and pushed total daily traffic past <strong>3000</strong>. The ArrayCast recap (link <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/ArrayCast%20Insights%20-%20Community%20Edition,%20Community%20Voices%20-%20Talking%20KDB-X%20on%20ArrayCast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) generated almost the same number of views, though overall traffic for that day leveled out just above 2000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Blog Page Views breakdown 2025" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/breakdown-6d09544fcb426ca6811c8f165ba0cf71.png" width="721" height="560" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Even more impressive is the breakdown of <strong>user activity</strong>: over the past year, <strong>total visits</strong> grew from <strong>30k</strong> to <strong>69k</strong>, more than a <strong>100%</strong> increase. Active users also doubled, climbing from just over <strong>5k</strong> to more than <strong>10k</strong>. A clear sign that developers see real value in the content I’m sharing.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reach">Reach<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Two%20Years%20of%20DefconQ%20-%20From%20Baby%20Steps%20to%20Big%20Leaps#reach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reach" title="Direct link to Reach">​</a></h3>
<p>Another key metric I track is reach, because what’s the point of creating content if it doesn’t reach people, right? Since my mission is to share KDB/Q knowledge and make this powerful array programming language more accessible, it’s important to connect with as many readers as possible. As with last year, the statistics below reflect a combination of my blog readership, my personal LinkedIn presence, and, new this year, my Substack newsletter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Blog Users by Country 2025" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/UserByCountry-efc4494484d3b395ee209f0b4040073d.png" width="950" height="406" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>One notable takeaway from the user-by-country breakdown is that the United States has now overtaken the United Kingdom, with the majority of users coming from the US. Another shift worth highlighting is Canada moving into fourth place, surpassing both Hong Kong and Ireland. While Ireland dropped out of the top ranks, Germany and Singapore made their way into the leaderboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Blog Users by City 2025" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/UserByCity-a2df26822eab827a8c0a59bb48201964.png" width="556" height="409" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>On the bright side, London held onto its spot as the city with the most active users.</p>
<p>Much like last year, most of my blog post announcements went out via my personal LinkedIn profile, so it makes sense to look at those numbers too. And honestly, they blew me away. Impressions nearly doubled, climbing from just under <strong>200k to 350k</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Alexander Unterrainer Linkedin Impressions 2025" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/impressions-c8b2f2516438b20dccf7307a5dd74bd0.png" width="814" height="576" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>My <strong>top-performing posts</strong> reached <strong>17.5k and 15k impressions</strong> each, and overall, more than 60k people engaged with my content. A milestone I’m truly proud of.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/defconq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DefconQ LinkedIn community</a> experienced a strong growth over the past year, reaching <strong>655 followers</strong>, a <strong>50% increase</strong> compared to the first year. This is a fantastic milestone considering most of the conversations still happen through my personal profile. On top of that, my <a href="https://defconq.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DefconQ Substack newsletter</a>, which I only launched a year ago, already has <strong>173 subscribers</strong>! If you haven’t joined yet, head over and subscribe, it’s free, and it guarantees you’ll never miss a blog post (they’ll come straight to your inbox!).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meetup-and-conferences">Meetup and Conferences<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Two%20Years%20of%20DefconQ%20-%20From%20Baby%20Steps%20to%20Big%20Leaps#meetup-and-conferences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meetup and Conferences" title="Direct link to Meetup and Conferences">​</a></h3>
<p>While I didn’t speak at any major conferences this year, I had the pleasure of hosting something even more special: the very <strong>first KDB/Q Community Happy Hour</strong> in London! Nearly <strong>60 developers</strong> joined at Flight Club in Shoreditch for an agenda-free evening full of darts, laughter, networking with both new and familiar faces and brilliant conversations. We stayed until the pub finally kicked us out. The energy and turnout were so encouraging that for DefconQ’s second anniversary, we’ll be hosting not one but <strong>TWO</strong> Happy Hours, one in Belfast and another in New York. You can read more about them here.</p>

<p>Following the <strong>anniversary</strong>, I’ll be back on the conference stage.

<p>2025 was a <strong>podcast-heavy</strong> year for me, I had the opportunity to appear on <strong>three podcast episodes</strong> in total: twice as a guest and once as a (guest) panelist!</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="top-10-podcast">Top 10% Podcast<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Two%20Years%20of%20DefconQ%20-%20From%20Baby%20Steps%20to%20Big%20Leaps#top-10-podcast" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Top 10% Podcast" title="Direct link to Top 10% Podcast">​</a></h4>
<p>Back in March, I had a great chat with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-whiting-b75a8ba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig Whiting</a>, MD of RLS Search, on his <em><strong>Top 10% Podcast</strong></em>. We explored the world of Tech in Finance, covering everything from banking graduate schemes and nepotism in investment banks to salary progression, promotions, and more. If you’re considering a career move, navigating the job market, or just starting out, this episode is well worth a listen.

<p>Next up was a real highlight and milestone for me, my first solo appearance on the ArrayCast, the must-listen podcast for array programming enthusiasts. While I had previously joined a group recording during Iverson College 2024, this was the first time I had a full episode to myself, which felt special. Given that The ArrayCast has featured some of the most respected names in the KDB/Q community, it was an honor to add my voice to that list. If you’re passionate about KDB/Q or array programming in general, this one's for you.

<p>My second appearance on The ArrayCast this year was as a (guest) panelist, stepping in for Stephen Taylor due to a scheduling clash in Stephen's diary. In episode 112, we welcomed Ashok Reddy, CEO of KX, who shared insights into the newly released KDB-X Community Edition. Together, we explored the motivations behind this release, its current state, and what’s next on the roadmap. Whether you’re a long-time KDB/Q practitioner or just getting started with this powerful array programming language, this episode is well worth a listen.

<p>Not every collaboration I explored this year materialised, but that’s part of the journey. What I did gain were incredible new connections, inspiring conversations, and friendships that I know will spark collaborations down the road. The seeds are planted, and I’m excited for what’s to come!</p>

<p>Technically, this isn’t an award or certificate, but to me, it feels like one. Earlier this year, I was honored to be nominated to the Advisory Board of <a href="https://www.alphaevents.com/events-quantstratsuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quant Strats</a>, the leading conference for quantitative professionals and finance practitioners. If you’re in finance, this is truly a must-attend event, and I can’t recommend it enough. Curious what to expect? I attended last year and shared a full recap <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/DefconQ%20goes%20QuantStrats%202024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Tickets for this year are still available, and with my link below, you can enjoy a <strong>20% discount</strong>.</p>

<p>As I shared last year, the most rewarding achievement for me is the overwhelmingly positive feedback from my readers. There’s nothing more fulfilling than when someone I’ve never met reaches out to thank me, saying my blog posts have been helpful or inspiring. More than once, I’ve had fellow developers recognize me at meetups and strike up a conversation about KDB/Q, which I’m always delighted to do. So if you ever spot me at a meetup, or even just walking around London, don’t hesitate to come and say hi. That kind of feedback is priceless, and it remains one of my strongest motivations to keep writing and sharing.</p>

<p>Being my own toughest critic, I also acknowledge my failures. Last year, I promised an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, but unfortunately, it didn’t happen. I’m making it up to you: I’ll be hosting the AMA this October, once all the meet-ups and conferences are wrapped up. During the session, I’ll do my best to answer your questions about KDB/Q, careers, or anything else you’d like to ask. It will take place on Reddit, and questions can be submitted completely anonymously. More details will be shared soon.</p>

<p>Iverson College is a unique residential gathering for developers and enthusiasts of array programming languages, such as APL, J, K, q, BQN, and more, honoring the legacy of Kenneth E. Iverson. Since its inaugural meeting in 2011 at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, the event has offered an invitation-only, immersive experience where participants live, work, and learn together in an informal environment. With past editions held in places like Tuscany and Suffolk, the conference brings together both seasoned implementers and curious newcomers for lively, unscripted conversations and spontaneous talks, without any agenda, offering an atmosphere richer and more collaborative than typical conferences. Past editions of Iverson College have a rich history of attracting leading voices from the KDB/Q community, with Arthur Whitney himself attending on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>The community met again in August 2024 in  Cambridge, with many of the ArrayCast team members in attendance, making it one of the most eclectic and engaging gatherings to date. You can revisit some of the event’s best moments in the highlight video below as well as in the ArrayCast episode 89, which was recorded at the Iverson College 2024.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Because of a scheduling conflict and the unavailability of Stephen Taylor, panelist of the well-known <strong>ArrayCast</strong>, I had the privilege of stepping in for my third appearance, this time as a (guest) panelist. Or, as the former ice hockey player in me would say, I got called up as the backup goalie.</p>
<p>In this episode, we welcomed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/areddy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashok Reddy</a>, <strong>CEO of KX</strong>, who shared insights on the newly released <strong>KDB-X Community Edition</strong>. We covered the motivations behind this move, the current state of the community edition, and what’s coming next on the roadmap.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about KDB/Q, what the new community edition brings to the table, and our broader discussion, I highly recommend tuning in.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-array-programming-languages">What Are Array Programming Languages?<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/ArrayCast%20Insights%20-%20Community%20Edition,%20Community%20Voices%20-%20Talking%20KDB-X%20on%20ArrayCast#what-are-array-programming-languages" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Are Array Programming Languages?" title="Direct link to What Are Array Programming Languages?">​</a></h2>
<p>Array programming languages, like APL, J, and K (the foundation of KDB/Q), are designed to operate on entire sets of data, <strong>arrays</strong>, with a single, concise expression. Unlike traditional languages that loop through elements one by one, array languages apply operations across whole vectors, matrices, or tables at once. This leads to <strong>massive gains in performance, readability, and expressiveness.</strong>  Their power lies in <strong>thinking and coding at a higher level of abstraction</strong>, closer to how data is naturally structured, making them a perfect choice in fields like quantitative finance, analytics, and high-performance computing. <strong>Fewer lines, faster code, smarter execution.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Array Cast</strong> is a podcast dedicated to the fascinating world of <strong>array programming languages</strong>, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>APL</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>J</strong></a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>K</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Q</strong></a>, and beyond. Hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorhoekstra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conor Hoekstra</a>, a well-known voice in the programming language community, the show features an expert panel including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrudz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adám Brudzewsky</a> (APL), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Taylor</a> (APL, Q), <a href="https://www.dyalog.com/dyalogue-newsletters.htm?nl=27&amp;a=162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marshall Lochbaum</a> (J, APL, BQN), and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-therriault-a096602b7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Therriault</a> (J). Together, they dive deep into the design, philosophy, and power of array-oriented programming, but always in a way that's engaging, insightful, and often entertaining. Even if you’ve never written a line of APL or Q, the Array Cast is worth your time: it offers a fresh perspective on problem solving, language design, and computational thinking that anyone in tech can appreciate.</p>

Just in time for <strong>DefconQ’s 2nd birthday</strong>,  we’re hosting <strong>not one, but two Happy Hours</strong>, on two different continents! I’m thrilled to announce the <strong>Brews &amp; Qs: Belfast Edition 🍻</strong>, hosted by <strong>DefconQ</strong> and kindly sponsored by <a href="https://kx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KX</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Join us for a relaxed evening of conversation, community, and cocktails at the KX Happy Hour, a casual meetup for <strong>KDB/Q developers</strong> to network, swap stories, and share ideas. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or just starting out, this is a great opportunity to connect with others who speak your language (literally).</p>
<p>This session’s conversation starter: the <a href="https://kdb-x.kx.com/sign-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>public preview of KDB-X Community Edition</strong></a>. We’ll chat about what’s new, how it might fit into your projects, and hear perspectives from fellow developers, all in an open, informal setting.</p>
<p>No slides, no agenda, just great conversations, good company, and a chance to strengthen your KDB-X/Q network.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is it ladies and gentlemen! The moment we’ve all been waiting for! KX just dropped the long-promised <strong>Community Edition</strong>, and <strong>IT'S FREE</strong>. Yes!!, you read that right: <strong>it's free</strong>. Not for a week. Not for personal use only. <strong>Free to use, even commercially</strong>. Holy cow, this honestly feels like Christmas came early this year. If you're wondering what all the hype is about and why I'm so excited about this breaking news, keep reading, you don't want to miss this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The cat is out of the bag - KX Community edition" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/cat-681d8f636fa5131ec315fbe35d314e18.png" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kdb-x-the-next-evolution-of-time-series-databases">KDB-X: The Next Evolution of Time-Series Databases<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/From%20Elite%20to%20Everyone%20-%20KX%20Community%20Edition%20Breaks%20Loose#kdb-x-the-next-evolution-of-time-series-databases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to KDB-X: The Next Evolution of Time-Series Databases" title="Direct link to KDB-X: The Next Evolution of Time-Series Databases">​</a></h2>
<p>First thing first, let's start with the biggest reveal: the name. The new KDB/Q release isn’t called 4.2 or 5.0… it’s now officially <strong>KDB-X</strong>. Whether this means we’re teaming up with Professor X, Wolverine, and the rest of the X-Men is still unconfirmed, but let’s just say I’m hopeful. Now, what exactly does this new edition bring? This is a public beta release, and KX has promised more features to come. But even in its current form, the offering is pretty generous. So, what’s actually included? A quick look at the product licensing page reveals that KDB-X gives you up to <strong>16GB of RAM</strong>, <strong>4 secondary threads per process</strong>, and <strong>8 IPC connections</strong>. Best of all, you can run it both on-premises and in the cloud, for personal and commercial use. Oh, and did I mention? PyKX is included too.</p>
<p>After KX made the big announcement, I couldn’t resist giving KDB-X a spin myself. I headed over to the public preview page and just a few clicks later, I was up and running with the new release. Installation? By far the smoothest KDB/Q setup I’ve experienced to date. One simple command in the terminal kicks things off, and a short guided setup later, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>What really stood out: transitioning from the previous version was completely seamless. No refactoring, no tweaks, no surprises. Everything just <em><strong>worked</strong></em> right out of the box.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="KDB-X - KX Community edition" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/kdb-x-5c5dd9fa6e8629370dd0cda09260f7a1.png" width="2320" height="1138" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>One frustrating <strong>"feature"</strong> that’s finally been removed?!? Remember trying to use the Personal Edition offline, like during travel, on a plane, or anytime you had spotty or no internet, only to be blocked because it needed to validate your license? That’s now a thing of the past. KDB-X runs completely offline with no connection required. Finally, I can actually get some work done mid-flight and take my mind off my totally irrational fear of flying (yes, I know it’s silly, but hey, we’ve all got our quirks).</p>
<p>Another pleasant surprise is that KX has made the Community Edition available not just for on-premise hardware, but also for cloud environments. Great news for all the cloud enthusiasts out there! Whether you're using GCP, Azure, or AWS, spinning up a virtual machine and running your KDB tick stack is now simpler than ever. Or, as LMC and U2 put it best: “Take me to the clouds above."</p>
<p>If you recall the promises made during the last KX meetup about a community edition, the first look at KDB-X suggests that KX is staying true to their word. While there may not be a flood of groundbreaking changes just yet, this release is a strong signal that KX is listening to its community and taking steps in the right direction. It feels like the momentum is shifting, and I’m optimistic there are plenty more updates and features on the horizon.</p>
<p>The fact that KDB-X Community Edition is free for commercial use is a game-changer. Within the limits of the community license, you can build, deploy, and even run production systems without spending a single penny. This opens up huge opportunities, especially for startups or smaller companies that want to prototype, test market fit, or build real-time analytics platforms without the upfront licensing costs. You get the power of KDB-X, Wall Street’s fastest time-series engine, with zero financial barrier to entry. It’s the perfect bridge to go from idea to production, and only scale up commercially when you’re ready.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is fantastic news for the entire KDB community. By lowering the entry barrier, it will attract more developers, spark greater interest, and, fingers crossed, lead to more job opportunities and roles across the industry.</p>
<p>So, what’s next for <em><strong>YOU</strong></em>? If you’re as excited as I am about this shift and curious to explore how you can use and benefit from KDB-X, whether it’s building, testing, experimenting, or just geeking out over all things KDB, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to connect and chat. In the meantime, here are some excellent resources to help you get started.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I had the honour of making my first solo appearance on the ArrayCast podcast, a show dedicated to everything array programming, and a tribute to the legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth E.

While I’ve previously been part of a group discussion during last year’s <a href="https://iversoncollege.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iverson College</a> event, this was my first time flying solo.</p>
<p>As many of you know, KDB/Q is a direct descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APL</a>, so it naturally finds a regular place in ArrayCast conversations. Over the years, the podcast has featured some of the most respected names in the KDB/Q community, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpsaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Psaris</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/attila-v-b948a52/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attila Vrabecz</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonny-press-7005602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonny Press</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevan-apter-1ba50488/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevan Apter</a>, which makes it an even greater privilege to join this esteemed list of guests and contribute to such a meaningful initiative.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-array-programming-languages">What Are Array Programming Languages?<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/The%20Array%20Cast%20-%20Where%20Code%20Meets%20Curiosity#what-are-array-programming-languages" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Are Array Programming Languages?" title="Direct link to What Are Array Programming Languages?">​</a></h2>
<p>Array programming languages, like APL, J, and K (the foundation of KDB/Q), are designed to operate on entire sets of data, <strong>arrays</strong>, with a single, concise expression. Unlike traditional languages that loop through elements one by one, array languages apply operations across whole vectors, matrices, or tables at once. This leads to <strong>massive gains in performance, readability, and expressiveness.</strong>  Their power lies in <strong>thinking and coding at a higher level of abstraction</strong>, closer to how data is naturally structured, making them a perfect choice in fields like quantitative finance, analytics, and high-performance computing. <strong>Fewer lines, faster code, smarter execution.</strong></p>

Johann highlighted that while headlines often focus on massive investments in “mega clusters” by tech giants, the enterprise market is more concerned with integrating AI into business processes. He addressed the challenges enterprises face in navigating the complex AI landscape, including governance, the sway of “random vendors” influencing AI projects within business units, and the critical need for predictable costs.</p>
<p>Johann emphasized six core capabilities that can address the majority of enterprise AI use cases, encouraging CIOs to prioritize these foundational elements instead of attempting to build an extensive array of capabilities. His presentation focused on the "how" of implementing AI in the enterprise, advocating for a factory-style approach to drive AI adoption across organizations effectively.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, in a groundbreaking move, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) revealed plans to extend after-hours trading on its Arca electronic exchange. Pending regulatory approval, this would expand Arca's operating hours from 1:30 a.m. ET to 11:30 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday, offering 22 hours of trading each weekday. This development follows other major exchange announcements this year, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE Group), backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities. To learn more about how these changes could reshape the electronic trading landscape, keep reading below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="NYSE extends trading hours" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/nyse-cb8854163136ba7515f62e5068318ccd.png" width="730" height="695" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-plan">The Plan<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/NYSE%20extends%20trading%20hours#the-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Plan" title="Direct link to The Plan">​</a></h2>
<p>First things first, let's examine the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) latest proposal. On Friday, the NYSE announced its plans to extend trading hours on its all-electronic Arca exchange to 22 hours a day.</p>
<p>This proposal aligns with growing interest in around-the-clock trading in U.S. markets. Robinhood, for example, introduced “24/5 trading” in May 2023, allowing trades from 8 p.m. ET on Sundays to 8 p.m. ET on Fridays. Meanwhile, global cryptocurrency markets already operate 24/7.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, NYSE Arca’s trading would open at 1:30 a.m. and close at 11:30 p.m. ET on weekdays, pending regulatory approval, according to the NYSE’s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange. Currently, extended trading hours on the NYSE range from 4 a.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET, with regular trading between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>NYSE Arca, a leading platform for trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and over 8,000 U.S.-listed securities, would allow trading of all U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and closed-end funds during these expanded hours.</p>
<p>The proposal comes in response to rising demand for U.S. securities trading. Kevin Tyrrell, Head of Markets at the New York Stock Exchange, commented, "The NYSE’s initiative to extend U.S. equity trading to 22 hours a day, five days a week highlights the strength of our U.S. capital markets and the increasing global demand for our listed securities. As the steward of U.S. capital markets, the NYSE is proud to lead the way in providing exchange-based trading access to our U.S.-listed companies and funds for investors across global time zones."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redefining-the-game-what-nyses-22-hour-trading-means-for-electronic-markets">Redefining the Game: What NYSE's 22-Hour Trading Means for Electronic Markets<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/NYSE%20extends%20trading%20hours#redefining-the-game-what-nyses-22-hour-trading-means-for-electronic-markets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Redefining the Game: What NYSE's 22-Hour Trading Means for Electronic Markets" title="Direct link to Redefining the Game: What NYSE's 22-Hour Trading Means for Electronic Markets">​</a></h2>
<p>What will these extended trading hours mean for the electronic trading landscape? Opinions are divided. While some market participants believe the impact will be limited and consider the proposal premature. Jim Toes, CEO of the Security Traders Association, noted in a CNBC interview, "The application seems very premature, as the demand for overnight and weekend exchange trading is still speculative." Dmitri Galinov, former head of Credit Suisse’s dark pool, holds a different view. “There is certainly demand from international markets, especially in South Korea, Japan, and parts of Europe,” he stated in a Sunday interview with CNBC.</p>
<p>He also pointed out a growing interest among U.S. retail traders who wish to trade at night, noting, “Many retail traders work during the day and want the option to trade past the current 8 p.m. cutoff when they get home.”</p>
<p>While demand from retail traders for extended hours is evident, the key question remains: will institutional traders follow suit? Although institutional investors are unlikely to be early adopters, and trading volumes are expected to be thin initially, competition around extended trading hours is undoubtedly intensifying. Earlier this year, TXSE Group, backed by BlackRock (BLK.N) and Citadel Securities, announced plans to launch the Texas Stock Exchange in Dallas, challenging the dominance of New York-based exchanges in an effort to attract global firms. With Citadel Securities—one of the world’s largest market makers—supporting TXSE, automation and extended trading hours appear increasingly likely, broadening stock market access.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is not a sponsored or paid blog post. I attended Quant Strats purely out of my passion and interest in Quantitative Finance and related topics. I frequently participate in meet-ups, conferences, presentations, and workshops focused on finance, quantitative finance, technology, FinTech, and crypto, driven by curiosity and enthusiasm. After all, it’s the field I work in.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to attend <a href="https://www.alphaevents.com/events-quantstratsuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuantStrats 2024</a> in London, one of the most highly anticipated quantitative finance conferences of the year. After a successful debut in New York last year, QuantStrats made its first appearance in the heart of the City of London, one of the world’s most historic financial hubs. While I'm sure you're eager to hear about the discussions, this post won’t be a recap of the event. Instead, I’ll focus on what made QuantStrats such a standout conference and why you should consider attending in the future if you get the chance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="content">Content<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/DefconQ%20goes%20QuantStrats%202024#content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Content" title="Direct link to Content">​</a></h2>
<p>QuantStrats featured an impressive variety of topics centered around quantitative finance, including alpha generation, risk management, portfolio optimization, and the application of generative AI in finance. A major focus of the conference was, unsurprisingly, data. With more data available today than ever before, discussions revolved around how to select, onboard, and extract maximum value from it, and how to make informed decisions based on that data. This led to presentations on AI, machine learning, NLP, and large language models (LLMs), exploring how these technologies can not only unlock value from data but also where and how they can add the most impact to an organization.</p>
<p>Given recent political and geopolitical developments—including two major ongoing wars and upcoming elections—another key theme was how to navigate the current macroeconomic landscape, protect assets, and continue generating alpha.</p>
<p>The third major topic of the conference was digital assets and crypto, focusing on how to leverage the digital assets space to diversify or hedge portfolios.</p>
<p>The presentations at QuantStrats were of the highest quality, thanks not only to the exceptional lineup of speakers—industry leaders from top-tier investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, and research institutions—but also to the careful curation of content. This was overseen by a specially formed advisory board, which included some of the most prominent names in finance. Among them were <strong>Michael Steliaros</strong>, Global Head of Portfolio Engineering and Trading at ADIA; <strong>Professor Petter Kolm</strong> from NYU; <strong>Sameer Gupta</strong>, Head of Data Solutions at Point72; <strong>Matt Greenwood</strong>, CIO of Two Sigma; <strong>Anthony Ledford</strong>, Chief Scientist at Man AHL; <strong>Stefan Zohren</strong>, Deputy Director of the Oxford-Man Institute; <strong>Florian Ielpo</strong>, Head of Macro and Multi-Asset Portfolio Manager at Lombard Odier Investment; and <strong>Nicole Koenigstein</strong>, Chief Data Scientist and Head of AI &amp; Quantitative Research at Wyden Capital.</p>
<p>Moreover, the conference never felt like a sales pitch. The presentations and content were entirely professional and focused on practical insights. There was just one brief session, structured as a series of five-minute elevator pitches, where five companies introduced or showcased how their data offerings, platforms, software, or tools could provide a competitive edge in the market. But that was the extent of it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speakers">Speakers<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/DefconQ%20goes%20QuantStrats%202024#speakers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Speakers" title="Direct link to Speakers">​</a></h2>
<p>The speaker lineup at QuantStrats was just as impressive as the content. With over 50 experts from leading institutions across the industry, the conference truly stood out. These professionals, with years—if not decades—of hands-on experience, covered a broad range of topics including Data and Data Sourcing, AI, ML, NLP, and LLMs, Portfolio and Risk Management, Alpha Generation and Portfolio Construction, Alternative Data and Investments, Crypto, and both Micro and Macro Economics. Together, they explored current trends, anticipated future developments, and addressed the most pressing challenges in the field.</p>
<p>The conference began with keynote speakers and panel discussions in the main room, while the afternoon sessions were split into different streams and tracks based on attendees’ interests. At times, the abundance of excellent speakers and presentations reminded me of being at one of the many electronic dance music (EDM) festivals I attend when I’m not blogging about KDB/Q—where you have to prioritize and choose between your favorite DJs and headliners due to overlapping set times. Similarly, at QuantStrats, I often faced tough decisions, having to pick one presentation over another. But that's certainly a good problem to have!</p>
<p>Some of the notable speakers included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Michael Steliaros</strong>, Global Head of Portfolio Engineering and Trading, ADIA</li>
<li><strong>Laura Serban</strong>, Managing Director, AQR</li>
<li><strong>Alex Remorov</strong>, Director, Systematic Active Equities, BlackRock</li>
<li><strong>James Munro</strong>, Head of ArcticDB, Man Group</li>
<li><strong>Joe Hanmer</strong>, Global Head of Quant, Fidelity International</li>
<li><strong>Mark Fleming-Williams</strong>, Head of Data Sourcing, Capital Fund Management</li>
<li><strong>Kimiya Minoukadeh</strong>, Director - Head of eFX Quants, ING</li>
<li><strong>Hamza Bahaji</strong>, Head of Financial Engineering, Amundi Asset Management</li>
<li><strong>Amadeo Alentorn</strong>, Head of Systematic Equities, Jupiter Asset Management</li>

<li><strong>Barry Fitzgerald</strong>, Co-Head of Front Office Engineering, Man Group</li>
<li><strong>Prasad Shinde</strong>, Lead Specialist - UK, I &amp; MENA, KX ...and many more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="attendees">Attendees<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/DefconQ%20goes%20QuantStrats%202024#attendees" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Attendees" title="Direct link to Attendees">​</a></h2>
<p>The attendees at QuantStrats were equally impressive. With over 75% of the audience coming from both the buy-side and sell-side, the event truly lived up to its reputation and sparked fascinating discussions. It brought together participants from all corners of the industry, and the excitement and engagement in the buzzing rooms were tangible. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals in the quant space, exchanging ideas on the latest trends, challenges, and solutions in the field. Regardless of experience or seniority, everyone was friendly, open, and approachable. I even had an interesting conversation during the lunch break with Aric Whitewood, CEO of XAI Asset Management, and David Mascio, one of the speakers. Attendees represented some of the biggest names in the industry, including but not limited to firms like <strong>Winton, Goldman Sachs, ADIA, Marshall Wace, Aspect Capital, Two Sigma, BlackRock, Man Group, Citadel, BlueCrest, Point72, JPMorgan, Jupiter, Balyasny Asset Management, AQR, KX, and many more</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="organisation">Organisation<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/DefconQ%20goes%20QuantStrats%202024#organisation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Organisation" title="Direct link to Organisation">​</a></h2>
<p>Aside from the outstanding lineup of speakers and presentations, the second most impressive aspect of QuantStrats was its flawless organization. The entire day flowed seamlessly. From arrival and registration to coordination and setup, everything was executed perfectly. The venue was carefully chosen to comfortably accommodate nearly 300 attendees. Even during the morning keynote sessions and panel discussions in the main room, it never felt crowded—there was plenty of space for everyone. The stage was visible from all angles, and audio monitors and screens ensured that everyone could see and hear the presentations clearly. The smaller breakout rooms for the afternoon sessions were just as well-equipped as the main hall.</p>
<p>After the individual afternoon presentations, the conference wrapped up with four interactive roundtable discussions, which added a refreshing, engaging touch.</p>
<p>One standout feature of the event was the app provided for the conference. Not only did it include the floor plan, agenda, and a list of all speakers and attendees, but it also offered detailed attendee profiles. You could filter by name, company, or interest, and the app even matched your interests with those of other attendees, making it easy to find common ground. You could connect with others, schedule meetings, and communicate via in-app messaging. For privacy, this was fully customizable according to your preferences.</p>
<p>As a final bonus, the slides and presentation decks were made available in the app after the conference. Overall, the organization was truly top-notch. While I’ve attended well-organized events before, this one set a new benchmark, raising the bar for conference standards.</p>
<p>It wasn't all about work—there was plenty of time to socialize, network, and enjoy the refreshments available during the three breaks throughout the day. A one-hour lunch break, featuring a healthy meal, gave everyone the chance to recharge and approach the afternoon sessions with renewed energy. In the evening, a reception and networking drinks provided the perfect opportunity to wrap up the conference in a relaxed and engaging atmosphere.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered all the great aspects of QuantStrats, let’s talk about the price. To my pleasant surprise, the cost was quite reasonable. There were two pricing tiers: one for the buy-side and one for the sell-side, each with four phases — <strong>Early Bird 1,Early Bird 2, Early Bird 3, and the Final Pricing phase</strong>. For the buy-side, the prices were <strong>£750, £850, £950, and £1,100</strong> for each phase, respectively. On the sell-side, the prices were <strong>£950, £1,050, £1,150, and £1,300</strong>. Additionally, groups of three or more received a 33% discount. Overall, I believe this was a very fair price for the value provided.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/DefconQ%20goes%20QuantStrats%202024#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>

<p>To land a job interview, you first need to clear the initial hurdle: the CV review. Whether you apply directly or through a recruiter, your CV will be the first thing evaluated. To ensure you get past this stage and make it to the interview, here are a few tips to help you pass the CV review:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Short and Catchy</strong>: Just like writing efficient KDB/Q code, your CV should be terse. Keep it to one A4 page. No matter how many internships or roles you've had, only include the most relevant ones. Even senior developers manage to keep it to one page, and so can you.</li>
<li><strong>Tailored Like a Suit</strong>: Your CV should be like a good suit: <em>Tailored</em>. While having a general CV is fine when starting your job search, it's better to customize it for each role. Highlight relevant skills and achievements, aligning them with the job requirements. This will make your CV stand out and help recruiters see if you're a match for the position.</li>
</ol>
<p>Things <strong>NOT</strong> to do when writing your CV:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't Lie:</strong> This should go without saying, but never exaggerate or fabricate skills or experiences. You'll likely get caught during the interview, and even if you don't, it will eventually catch up with you.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Unnecessary Details:</strong> Skip the headshot and your age. These details aren't necessary and can detract from your qualifications. Keep the focus on your skills and experience.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparation-the-key-to-a-successful-job-application">Preparation: the Key to a Successful Job Application<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#preparation-the-key-to-a-successful-job-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Preparation: the Key to a Successful Job Application" title="Direct link to Preparation: the Key to a Successful Job Application">​</a></h2>
<p>As the Japanese proverb goes, "Better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war." The same applies to job applications—you want to be as prepared as possible. Here are a few tips to help you get ready for success.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-role">The Role<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#the-role" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Role" title="Direct link to The Role">​</a></h3>
<p>The best way to succeed in a job application is to gather as much information as possible about the role you're applying for. This not only ensures you're a good fit, but also helps you determine if the role aligns with your expectations and career goals. Start early by carefully reading the job description and asking the recruiter for more details before your first interview. This will help you prepare effectively. Once you're in the interview process, keep asking relevant questions to the hiring manager, interviewers, and potential team members. Remember, interviews are a two-way street. While the company is assessing your skills, you should also evaluate if the role and workplace are right for you.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-preparation-master-the-art-of-showcasing-your-skill">Technical Preparation: Master the Art of Showcasing Your Skill<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#technical-preparation-master-the-art-of-showcasing-your-skill" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical Preparation: Master the Art of Showcasing Your Skill" title="Direct link to Technical Preparation: Master the Art of Showcasing Your Skill">​</a></h3>
<p>The key to landing your dream job is, of course, having the right skill set for the role. While you may already possess most or all of the required skills, it’s important to prepare and refresh your knowledge before the interview. Often in your current role, you focus on specific tasks and might not need the broader knowledge that an interview demands. During the interview process, you'll likely be questioned on a wide range of topics across multiple sessions, so it's crucial to review and sharpen your technical skills.</p>
<p>The depth of technical questioning typically depends on the level of the role. For junior to mid-level positions, interviews tend to focus on hands-on programming experience. For senior roles, however, you’ll need to demonstrate knowledge in architecture, software design, and building or extending applications. Ensuring you're comfortable with these topics will greatly enhance your chances of success.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Be prepared for live coding. It’s a common practice to be asked to demonstrate your skills in real-time, so make sure you're ready for this aspect of the interview. Although preparing for KDB/Q live coding is a bit more challenging, many big FAANG tech companies often use <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a> for their coding challenges. If you're interviewing at one of these companies, I highly recommend practicing <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a> problems to sharpen your skills.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="emotional-quotient-eq-social-skills">Emotional Quotient (EQ): Social Skills<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#emotional-quotient-eq-social-skills" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Emotional Quotient (EQ): Social Skills" title="Direct link to Emotional Quotient (EQ): Social Skills">​</a></h3>
<p>While the technical aspect is the main focus of any software developer or engineering interview, your social skills and emotional intelligence (EQ) are equally important. After all, you'll be spending around eight hours a day at work, making it crucial for the hiring manager to find someone who fits well with the team culture and can collaborate effectively. Not everyone is an extrovert, and many of us prefer working independently, but emotional intelligence can be developed, at least to some degree. Here are a few tips to help you feel more comfortable and socially engaged:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attend (tech) meetups and interact with new people.</li>
<li>If you're into sports, join a club or any type of group activity.</li>
<li>Use your current job as a "practice field" for improving your social skills—go to team drink or organize activities with coworkers, and make an effort to socialize with colleagues outside your immediate team.</li>
</ol>

<p>Acing interviews is a skill in itself. I’ve met many talented software engineers who struggle under the pressure of an interview, while others, who may be less technical, have mastered the art of interviewing and excel in those situations. Fortunately for you, I’m sharing my top strategies to boost your chances of landing your dream job.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="practice-after-all-practice-makes-mastery">Practice! After all, practice makes mastery<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#practice-after-all-practice-makes-mastery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Practice! After all, practice makes mastery" title="Direct link to Practice! After all, practice makes mastery">​</a></h3>
<p>Like any other skill, practice leads to mastery, and interviews are no exception. The more interviews you do, the better you’ll become over time. However, unlike other skills, interviews aren’t something you typically practice for. So how can you improve? Just like mock exams help with exam prep, you can create mock interview scenarios. Put yourself in the position of a hiring manager and think about what questions you’d ask a candidate. Then, try answering them yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, this is far less stressful than a real interview, so a better option is to ask a friend (most developers have developer friends) or an ex-colleague to give you a mock interview. You could also apply for roles you're not interested in, just to gain interview experience. However, take this advice with a pinch of salt. You don’t want to risk damaging your reputation by underperforming or turning down offers after a successful interview. For mainstream developer roles, practicing LeetCode challenges is another great way to sharpen your skills before the actual interview.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-put-all-your-eggs-into-one-basket">Don't put all your eggs into one basket<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#dont-put-all-your-eggs-into-one-basket" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Don't put all your eggs into one basket" title="Direct link to Don't put all your eggs into one basket">​</a></h3>
<p>If you've worked in finance, you're likely familiar with the concept of diversification. The same principle can be applied to your job search. To improve your chances of landing a role, apply for multiple positions. However, diversification has diminishing returns, so it’s wise to limit your applications to three to five at a time. This allows you to focus your time and energy on each application, boosting the likelihood of success.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-penny-for-your-thoughts---share-your-thought-process">A penny for your thoughts - Share your thought process<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#a-penny-for-your-thoughts---share-your-thought-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A penny for your thoughts - Share your thought process" title="Direct link to A penny for your thoughts - Share your thought process">​</a></h3>
<p>During technical interviews, it can be difficult for the interviewer to follow your thought process if you don’t explain it. Let me clarify: Imagine you've been asked to write a program to calculate the next Fibonacci number in a sequence. You take a moment, solve the problem, and give an answer - whether correct or not. Without explaining your reasoning, the interviewer has no insight into how you approached the problem, how you think, or where you may have gone wrong.</p>
<p>A much better approach is to "think out loud" and walk the interviewer through your solution. For example, if asked to write a function that returns the next number in a Fibonacci sequence, you could explain your thought process step-by-step:</p>
<p>“In a Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Given a list of numbers <code>x</code>, we need to take the last two elements using <code>-2#x</code>. Then, we sum them using the <code>sum</code> operator, and finally, append this result to the end of the list using the concatenate operator <code>,</code>. So, the solution is <code>{x,sum -2#x}</code>."</p>
<p>This approach not only demonstrates your problem-solving skills but also gives the interviewer a chance to guide you if you’re on the wrong track, especially with more complex questions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="situational-questions---shine-with-the-star-appraoch">Situational Questions - Shine with the S.T.A.R appraoch<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#situational-questions---shine-with-the-star-appraoch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Situational Questions - Shine with the S.T.A.R appraoch" title="Direct link to Situational Questions - Shine with the S.T.A.R appraoch">​</a></h3>
<p>Every interview contains at least a couple of situational questions: questions about how you behave in certain situations and how you overcome certain problems you might face. Answering these kind of interview questions can sometimes be tricky, especially for a more technical minded person. One way how to approach these questions is to remember the S.T.A.R approach: Situation, Task, Action and Result. First describe the Situation you have been in, what was the context or environment around you like. Next, explain the Task you were given, then proceed to explaining the Actions you have taken and finally explain the Result you achieved. This approach gives you a clear guideline to structure and communicate your answer</p>

<p>While preparation is key and practice makes mastery, avoid over-relying on sample interview questions. Memorizing specific answers can be limiting. If you face a slightly different question, you might struggle to adapt. Instead, focus on deeply understanding the underlying concepts and how to apply them to various problems. This will give you the flexibility to tackle any question, even if it differs from what you’ve practiced.</p>

<p>Along with the strategies to boost your chances of landing a job, there are also a few things you should avoid doing.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-lie">Don't Lie<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#dont-lie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Don't Lie" title="Direct link to Don't Lie">​</a></h3>
<p>Just like with your CV, I strongly believe you should never lie during a job interview—whether it’s about your past experiences, skills, certifications, or anything else. Eventually, the truth will catch up, and it could severely damage your reputation, marking you as untrustworthy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-honest-dont-fabricate-answers--no-one-knows-it-all">Be Honest: Don't Fabricate Answers – No One Knows it All<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#be-honest-dont-fabricate-answers--no-one-knows-it-all" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Be Honest: Don't Fabricate Answers – No One Knows it All" title="Direct link to Be Honest: Don't Fabricate Answers – No One Knows it All">​</a></h3>
<p>There may come a time during an interview when you're unsure of the answer to a question. I've been in these situations myself, and I prefer to admit that I don’t know or am unsure, rather than guessing or, worse, fabricating an answer. Admitting you don’t know shows honesty and integrity. As someone who’s interviewed candidates, I’d much rather see someone admit they’re unsure than catch them in a fabricated answer, which is a major red flag and usually leads to a "no hire." Here's a tip: there’s a better way to admit uncertainty. Instead of just saying “I don’t know,” explain how you would approach finding the answer or where you would look. This can make a big difference.</p>

<p>Once your interview is over, there's not much you can do except be patient and wait for feedback. I know it’s easier said than done, and I’m not the most patient person myself, but since you're likely not the only candidate, it may take the hiring manager a few days to respond. Just remember, until you hear otherwise, you're still in the game.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keep-preparing-stay-ahead-of-the-game">Keep Preparing: Stay Ahead of the Game<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/How%20to%20Successfully%20Prepare%20for%20an%20Interview%20and%20Land%20Your%20Dream%20Job#keep-preparing-stay-ahead-of-the-game" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Keep Preparing: Stay Ahead of the Game" title="Direct link to Keep Preparing: Stay Ahead of the Game">​</a></h3>
<p>Most roles you'll apply for will involve multiple rounds of interviews, so it's unlikely you'll only have one. After your first interview, continue preparing for the next round. Reflect on how it went: What questions were asked? What did you do well? Where could you improve? This self-review will help you gear up for future interviews, as it’s rare to face the same questions again. If you were unsure about certain topics, revisit them so you're more confident for the next round.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we have to face setbacks, and not receiving the job offer you wanted can be frustrating. However, you have two options: 1. Stay upset and do nothing, or 2. Take a moment to process the disappointment, then reflect on how to improve for the next opportunity. Remember, it might not always be about you; sometimes a more suitable candidate simply comes along. Ask the hiring manager or recruiter for feedback on your performance and areas to improve. There’s always a chance the company will have future openings, and you can reapply with the lessons you’ve learned.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You've done it! Your hard work paid off, and you've received a job offer. Take a moment to celebrate and be proud of your achievement. Now it's time to handle the formalities of accepting the offer and preparing for your new role. Well done!</p>

<p>Always keep in mind that an interview is a two-way process. While the company is evaluating whether you're the right fit and if your skill set aligns with their needs, you should also assess if the role is truly what you're looking for. Consider whether the hiring manager or technical lead is someone you'd enjoy working with and if the team has a positive culture where you can grow, learn, and develop. Remember, taking on a new role is a commitment, and ideally, you'll want to stay in that position for at least a few years before considering your next move.</p>

<p>Let's begin with the metric that is personally the most significant for me: the number of blog posts published. Over the past year, I've shared <strong>26</strong> pieces of content (including this one) on my blog, ranging from blog posts to learning materials. While some pieces took more time to create than others, I've maintained an average of publishing new content every two weeks. For me, this consistency is a significant achievement. While some posts were less technical than others, I believe that most of them added value in one way or another. This is reflected in the website traffic, as shown in the Google Analytics report below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Google Analytics Page Views" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/pageViews-e811982f6e2502d589ff0fd8ec9b7f94.png" width="1905" height="652" class="img_ev3q">

<p>As the breakdown shows, DefconQ received over <strong>30,000 views</strong> from <strong>5,223 visitors</strong> in the past year. The most popular posts were <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/docs/architecture/plain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Plain Vanilla Tick Setup</a>, <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/docs/tutorials/tick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KDB Tick Explained: A Walkthrough</a>, and <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/Go-To%20KDB/Q%20Learning%20Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go-To KDB/Q Learning Resources</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reach">Reach<a href="https://defconq.github.io/blog/Happy%20Birthday%20DefconQ#reach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reach" title="Direct link to Reach">​</a></h3>
<p>A closely related metric I was particularly interested in is the actual reach of <strong>DefconQ</strong>. Since most updates are posted from my personal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderunterrainer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin</a> account, DefconQ's standalone reach doesn't fully capture the overall impact. Therefore, I've included both my personal reach and DefconQ's reach in this analysis. We already know that the DefconQ blog attracted over <strong>5,000</strong> visitors last year. Now, let's take a closer look at the demographics of these visitors.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Google Analytics Users by Country" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/UserByCountry-4fdf4ecf38b5452b75e9008e1860aed7.png" width="948" height="402" class="img_ev3q">
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="DefconQ Google Analytics Users by City" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/UserByCity-b03582cc7f758d5af47dd0780904bb1e.png" width="547" height="403" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It's no surprise that the United Kingdom and the United States are the predominant countries, with London and New York being the cities with the most users. However, what comes as a surprise is the fact that even smaller countries or countries where KDB/Q is traditionally not present showed interest in DefconQ. Such countries include Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile,Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Norway, Sweden, Finland or China, among others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Alexander Unterrainer Linkedin Impressions" src="https://defconq.github.io/assets/images/impressions-3b5ccb650f2e1cf7737fcac18ef48f4d.png" width="814" height="595" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Although my LinkedIn account generated nearly 200k impressions over the past year, with top-performing posts averaging around 6-7k impressions each, I’m not a huge fan of this metric because it doesn’t necessarily indicate engagement. LinkedIn defines impressions as the number of times a post is visible for at least 300 milliseconds, with at least 50 percent of the post in view on a signed-in member’s device or browser window (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a564051/content-analytics-for-your-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: LinkedIn</a>). However, considering that roughly 10,000 people list KDB/Q as one of their skills on LinkedIn, it’s quite impressive that my posts reach about two-thirds of them.</p>

<p>Over the past year, <strong>DefconQ</strong> gained <strong>434</strong> followers on LinkedIn—a modest number, likely due to the fact that I primarily share updates from my personal account rather than the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/defconq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DefconQ</a> page. Since most of my KDB/Q network is connected to my personal profile, it made sense to post updates there to reach a broader audience. However, if you're reading this and don't yet follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/defconq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DefconQ</a> on LinkedIn, I encourage you to head over and give it a follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/defconq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>

<p>After a six-year break, <a href="https://iversoncollege.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iverson College</a>, organized by the well-known <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Taylor</a>, made its return to Trinity Hall in Cambridge this summer. Iverson College is a residential event for array programming enthusiasts to explore and discuss topics related to vector programming languages. This year’s conference featured an incredibly impressive lineup of <a href="https://iversoncollege.com/participants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">participants</a>, including both language implementers and developers. The wealth of experience, knowledge, and expertise present made this a truly unique experience for me and one of the standout highlights of this year's KDB/Q events.</p>

<p><a href="https://kx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KX</a>, along with the KXperts team led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaela-woods-50502b60/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michaela Woods</a>, has begun hosting livestreams as part of the revamp of their KX Academy. For their second episode, I had the pleasure of joining Michaela and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthiafaus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cynthia Faus Viadé</a> to discuss KDB/Q Architecture. I believe this is a fantastic initiative to spread KDB/Q knowledge and connect with a broader audience, as the livestreams are accessible from anywhere in the world. If you missed the livestream, no worries! I've written a detailed summary <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/DefconQ%20meets%20KX%20-%20Mastering%20KDB+%20Architecture%20-%20A%20Panel%20Discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, which also includes the recording of the discussion.</p>

<p>Another new milestone for DefconQ was joining the seasoned podcaster and YouTuber <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-bianco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimitri Bianco</a> on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DimitriBianco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fancy Quant - Talking Tuesday</a> podcast. Dimitri and I had an in-depth conversation about all things KDB/Q and Quant finance. We discussed why KDB/Q is so prevalent in the financial industry and what makes it an excellent choice for building applications. We also covered how to kickstart a career in Quant Finance, which degrees and universities are relevant, how to advance in your career, and even debated the pros and cons of living in a big city versus a more remote location. Dimitri is a fantastic host, and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. The podcast touches on a broad range of topics, not just KDB/Q. If you're interested in Quantitative Finance or KDB/Q, this episode is a must-listen.

<p>The stellar lineup at <a href="https://iversoncollege.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iverson College 2024</a>, which included <a href="https://www.arraycast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArrayCast</a> host <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorhoekstra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conor Hoekstra</a> and nearly all the regular panelists - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Taylor</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrudz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adám Brudzewsky</a> and Bob Therriault - made it the perfect setting to record an episode of ArrayCast in the historic halls of Trinity College, Cambridge. This also gave me the exciting opportunity to make my debut on the ArrayCast podcast as one of the many participants in this special episode.

<p>At the start of this year, I received a somewhat unexpected email from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-taylor-b5ba78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Taylor</a> - an APL and KDB/Q enthusiast and the former librarian of the official KX documentation, a developer who hardly needs an introduction in the KDB/Q community. Stephen shared details about his latest project, <a href="https://q201.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q201</a>, an initiative aimed at teaching and explaining KDB/Q at a deep technical and language level. He was also looking to engage more with the KDB/Q community by hosting online workshops and tutoring sessions for interested students. After discovering my blog, Stephen invited me to contribute to his project—a request I was honored to accept. How could I possibly turn down such an esteemed invitation? Since then, I’ve been assisting Stephen with reviewing the content of Q201, providing feedback on areas that might need more detail, and helping to host and coordinate several online workshops with different students. I really enjoy working on this project because it offers a different approach from mine and deepens my understanding of KDB/Q. I highly recommend Q201 to anyone interested in KDB/Q.</p>

<p>One of my proudest moments this year was being recognized by KX as the first KDB/Q developer to receive the "Black Tier," the highest level in their KXpert Advocacy Program, for my work with DefconQ. This award is not only a significant honor but also the ultimate validation hat the content I create is making a valuable impact on the KDB/Q Community. If you're interested in learning more about the KXpert Advocacy Program and how to get involved, you can read about it in my blog post <a href="https://www.defconq.tech/blog/KXperts%20-%20A%20Developer%20Advocacy%20Program%20by%20KX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p>The most rewarding achievement, however, is the overwhelmingly positive feedback I receive from my blog readers. It's incredibly fulfilling when a stranger reaches out to thank me for the content I share, expressing how my blog posts have been helpful or inspirational. That kind of feedback is truly amazing and one of my biggest motivations to continue doing what I do. Here are a few highlights of the feedback I've received over the past year.</p>

<p>After reflecting on the milestones DefconQ has achieved over the past year, I'd like to take this final section to look ahead at what's in store for the future. Obviously, I'll continue to post content in the form of blog posts, technical articles, podcasts, and livestreams. I also plan to keep participating in conferences and meet-ups. However, there are some new initiatives on the horizon, including in-person events for my blog readers, KDB/Q developers, and aspiring KDB/Q professionals. While I can't reveal all the exciting projects just yet, I can share that I'll be hosting an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session soon. In this AMA, I'll answer all your questions about KBD/Q, how to learn it, advance your career, break into the KDB/Q world, or anything else you'd like to know.
